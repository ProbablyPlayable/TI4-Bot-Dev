//! Battle inputs and the frozen space-combat predictor (ARENA-002).
//!
//! One encoding serves both the arena trainer and live play, so the predictor never sees a
//! different vector in a game than it was trained on. The predictor itself is a plain-Rust
//! forward pass: the live policy crate must not depend on the tensor library.
//!
//! Scope: the six factions the bots play, with and without upgrades, space combat only, both
//! sides' space cannon before combat, the declared sustain-first casualty order. A side
//! containing anything else is unsupported rather than approximated.
//!
//! Feature versions. A predictor records the version it was trained on and is fed exactly that:
//!
//! - **1** — ships, damage and dice shift per side; three outcome probabilities. A destination
//!   with guns on its planets is unsupported, and one without enemy ships is not a fight.
//! - **2** — adds guns per side (PDS, PDS II, the Xxcha mech on planets there, and guns next door
//!   whose cards reach), so a move into a covered system with no enemy ships is a fight too; and
//!   adds each ship type's expected survival.
//! - **3** — version 2's space network unchanged, plus a ground network for invasion commits:
//!   ground forces, damage and dice shift per side, the defender's PDS (space cannon defense) and
//!   the L1Z1X invader's Harrow ships; outcome and survival per ground-force type.
//! - **4** — the space input gains a flag for a fight already under way (space cannon and the
//!   round-1 barrage behind it), and retreat announcements carry the odds of staying in.
//! - **5** — version 4's networks and encoding unchanged; activation options gain what defends
//!   the destination's planets, ground forces and structures counted apart.
//!
//! - **6** — activation options also summarise the candidate fleets that could be sent
//!   (`tactical_plan`): best space win, the cheapest favoured fleet, the best conditional take, how
//!   exposed a favoured fleet leaves home, how many candidates there are. Package facts are
//!   appended too, for version 7.
//! - **7** — version 6's facts; the bot also samples which candidate fleet to send and the plan
//!   answers the movement and cargo prompts.
//!
//! From version 5 on, a version only adds facts: the encoding stays version 4's, so a predictor
//! moves up with [`BattlePredictor::relabelled`] and no retraining.
