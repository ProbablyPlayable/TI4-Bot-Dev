//! The MLP input projection (M09-024b1, Tier-C architecture ruling of 2026-08-25).
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! The MLP does not consume the schema-4 explicit vector as emitted. It consumes a **projection**
//! of it, applied *before* vocabulary lookup: unbounded memorisation crosses are suppressed, and
//! the eight acting-seat facts are restored under a bounded bare family.
//!
//! # Why a projection rather than a change to the extractor
//!
//! The schema-4 vector is what six trained champions score with, and what M09-019b's inventory pin
//! and the legacy-subvector pin protect. Changing it to suit the MLP would move every one of those
//! at once. So the extractor is left exactly as it is and the MLP takes a different **view** of its
//! output. `explicit_choice_features` is byte-for-byte what it was; everything here is downstream
//! of it.
//!
//! # What is suppressed, and why it is a predicate rather than a list
//!
//! An **unbounded memorisation cross** is a family whose identity is the Cartesian product of two
//! free lexical identities, or of a full option identity and a state fact. Measured over the §6.1
//! schedule, three such families were 91.3% of a 203,843-name vocabulary — a dense column each, at
//! `width` weights apiece, for names seen in a vanishing fraction of games by construction.
//!
//! The ruling states this as a predicate on family *shape*, not as a list to maintain: any new
//! family with either shape is excluded by default and needs an architecture review to enter the
//! dense input. [`EXCLUDED_FAMILIES`] is the current grammar's answer to the predicate, not the
//! predicate itself.
//!
//! `state-kind` survives the predicate deliberately: its crossing axis is the bounded canonical
//! decision kind, so its columns transfer between games rather than naming one option in one board.
//!
//! # Suppressed, not routed
//!
//! An excluded name is dropped before lookup. It does **not** fall into its family's OOV column.
//! Those three reserved rows stay in the registry so that no v1 index moves, and are permanently
//! dead: never a routing destination, zeroed and masked from optimization by M09-026/M09-028.
//! Collapsing 186,088 distinct names into three columns would inject a dense signal that means
//! nothing, which is worse than dropping them.
