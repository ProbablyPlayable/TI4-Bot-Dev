//! Factual features for a learned policy (M09-003).
//!
//! Ported from the oracle's `HashedLinearPolicy.features`.
//!
//! Everything here is an **observation**, never a judgement. "This option's kind is `activate`",
//! "the prompt contained the word *system*", "the seat holds four trade goods" — facts a rule
//! could check, with no opinion attached about whether any of them is good. The opinion is the
//! weight, and the weight is fitted.
//!
//! That line is the whole point of the module and M09-014 exists to prove it holds: if an authored
//! score leaked in here as a feature, a "fully learned" policy would be quietly reading somebody's
//! hand-tuned constants and reporting itself as having learned them.
//!
//! # Hashing
//!
//! Names are hashed straight into signed buckets as they are added, so what comes out is already
//! the sparse vector a trainer updates. Two names landing in one bucket **sum**, which is the
//! hashing trick working as intended rather than a collision to avoid: the fixed-size vector is
//! what lets an unbounded set of facts train without the weight file growing.
//!
//! A zero or non-finite value is dropped rather than stored. A zero contributes nothing to a score
//! and nothing to a gradient, and storing it would make a vector's size depend on how many facts
//! happened to be zero.
