//! Redacted views of the game state (M08-001).
//!
//! Ported from the oracle's `engine/views.py`.
//!
//! Some things in TI4 are private: the action cards in your hand, the secret objectives you
//! hold. Everything else — the board, who controls what, how many victory points everyone has —
//! is open information any player may read.
//!
//! A view replaces the private parts of *other* players rather than removing them. A hand of four
//! unknown cards becomes four [`HIDDEN`] markers, so its **size** stays visible, which is correct:
//! at a real table you can see how many cards somebody holds without seeing which.
//!
//! Replacing rather than deleting matters for a second reason. Every existing query keeps working
//! against a view, so nothing has to learn about redaction to be safe. Code that only counts is
//! unaffected; only code that inspects a specific card sees the marker, and a marker is not a card
//! id, so it matches nothing.
