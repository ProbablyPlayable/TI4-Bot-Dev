//! The replayer window: the reviewer's board, plus a hand on the table.
//!
//! The layout is the reviewer's, on purpose. The top bar is files and status; the bottom bars are
//! seats, running, and the frame strip; the left sheet is the branch list, then the players; the right
//! sheet is the choice that is waiting, with the step detail under it; the middle is the map. Only four
//! things here do not exist in R01, and they are the reason a second application exists: six seat
//! chips, the panel that appears when a manual seat is asked something, the branch strip, and Play.
//!
//! The window decides nothing by itself. Every question a click raises - may I fork here, what does this
//! button do to a parked decision, is this branch replayable, is a rebuild in flight - goes to
//! [`ReplayApp`], and the answer comes back as a decision or as the sentence to show. What the window
//! owns is what it draws: the frames each branch has sent, the tile under the pointer, and the panel
//! widths.
//!
//! It also cannot hold a game. A `LiveReview` is not `Send`, so every branch runs on its own thread and
//! sends its frames through the gate's feed; [`Replayer::poll`] drains that feed once per repaint and
//! appends what arrived. Two borrowing tricks make the panels compile without copying: the [`Opened`]
//! record is taken out of `self` for the duration of a paint, and the frame store inside it is taken
//! out in turn, so frames can be borrowed by name while the app beside them is mutated.
