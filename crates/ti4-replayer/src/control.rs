//! Seat control, pending manual choices, choice fingerprints, replay records, provenance.
//!
//! These are the pieces a human sits between: the engine asks a question, the replayer decides
//! whether the learned policy answers it or a person does, and the answer is recorded so the same
//! line can be rebuilt later. Everything here is a plain value or a small state machine over plain
//! values — no engine call, no I/O, no thread — because the same definitions have to serve the
//! simulation thread, the project file, and the branch tree.
//!
//! Two facts about the engine shape this vocabulary, and are worth knowing before reading it:
//!
//! * One `Game::step()` can raise several decisions. A measured reference session put 670 settled
//!   decisions across 602 engine steps, with one production step consuming eight. So a pending
//!   choice carries an `ask` index within its frame, not just a frame number.
//! * `Game::legal_options()` cannot see every decision a step will ask — the open transaction
//!   window in particular is dispatched before it. The decorator that actually gets asked is
//!   therefore the authoritative pause trigger, and these types never assume otherwise.

// `SeatControl`/`ManualControl`/`ControlError` are the names callers should see; renaming them to
// dodge a naming-shape lint would only make the API harder to read from a call site.
