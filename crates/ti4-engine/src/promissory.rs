//! Promissory notes (LRR 69).

//! Ported from the oracle's `engine/promissory.py`. Transactions carried a promissory field long
//! before this existed, but no player owned a note and moving one changed no state — so every
//! note in the game was a name on an offer that did nothing.
//!
//! Support for the Throne is the scoring consequence of that gap, and the reason this is worth
//! having at all: receiving it is worth a victory point, and it is the one note whose *position*
//! scores. It lives in [`GameState::support_holders`] rather than the general note map for
//! exactly that reason, and a great deal of scoring reads it directly.
//!
//! Every note says "then, return this card": a note is a loan, not a sale. [`give_back`] is what
//! makes that true, and it is why parting with one is priced below what receiving it is worth.
