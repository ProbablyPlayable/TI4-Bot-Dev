//! Legendary planet abilities.
//!
//! Sixteen legendary planets exist, described by nineteen corpus records -- Mallice has a tile
//! face each side of the Nexus flip, and Mirage carries two alternate printings that nothing
//! places. Each has a `legendaryAbilityName` and its text, and until this module nothing read
//! either: `Planet::is_legendary` answered a bool used for excluding them from
//! Stellar Converter and counting them for objectives, and the printed ability did nothing at all.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! A registry keyed by planet, like [`crate::action_cards::effect_for`] and the relic table: a
//! planet with no entry is a visible gap rather than a silent one. Most of these are "you may
//! exhaust this card at the end of your turn", which is a window the engine already drives --
//! `technology::end_turn` runs it for Bio-Stims and Predictive Intelligence -- so the abilities
//! hang off that rather than needing timing machinery of their own.
//!
//! Three more read "when you pass". That window did not exist; [`pass`] is it, called from the
//! pass branch of the action phase.
//!
//! Two abilities are neither: the Ionian Fuel Refinery is offered as the extra reach it buys, from
//! inside the movement step, and Dok 'N Pic's Salvage Yard is half a window and half a card zone --
//! stocking it is a pass ability, playing out of it is a second place the play paths look.
//!
//! The ability card exhausts separately from the planet (`seat.exhausted_legendary`, readied in
//! the status phase beside technologies and relics), because a seat can spend Primor for its two
//! resources and still use The Atrament in the same round.
//!
//! # Not here
//!
//! Avernus, Ordinian and Custodia Vigilia are faction-specific -- they borrow another faction's
//! ability, sit in a faction's starting position, or arrive with a faction technology -- and are
//! deliberately left out rather than half-modelled.
