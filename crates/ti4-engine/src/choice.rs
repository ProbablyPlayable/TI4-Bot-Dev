//! Choices: the single way any actor decides anything.
//!
//! Every decision in the game — which ability to resolve in an open window, which action to
//! take on your turn, how to vote — is the same shape: *the engine enumerates legal options,
//! and an actor picks one of them*. Nothing else is a decision point.
//!
//! That shape is what makes several guarantees hold at once:
//!
//! * the engine is authoritative, because options are generated, never accepted from outside;
//! * a bot or an LLM can only ever select a legal option, with no channel to invent one;
//! * decisions are recorded, so a game replays exactly from a seed plus its decision log;
//! * an actor sees only the [`Choice`] it is handed and the public facts in [`Observed`],
//!   never another player's hand.
//!
//! [`Decider`] is deliberately tiny. Human input, a scripted conformance test, a seeded
//! random smoke run, and a scored bot are all the same interface.
//!
//! Ported from the oracle's `engine/choice.py`. The oracle's `Option` is [`ChoiceOption`]
//! here, because a type called `Option` in scope alongside `std::option::Option` is a trap.
