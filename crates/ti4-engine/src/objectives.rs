//!
//! Ported from the oracle's `engine/objectives.py`.
//!
//! Objective cards carry their requirement as English prose — "Control 6 planets in non-home
//! systems" — so there is nothing to evaluate mechanically. Each therefore needs a predicate,
//! registered here against the card's alias. The *cards* stay data; only the requirement
//! checks are code.
//!
//! **An objective with no registered predicate cannot be scored.** That is the oracle's design

//! never silently scoreable, so coverage gaps show up as an objective nobody can take rather
//! than as a bot quietly winning on a rule that was never written.
