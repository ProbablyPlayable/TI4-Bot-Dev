//! The TI4 rules engine.
//!
//! # State of this crate
//!
//! Small, and honest about it. It holds setup, the phase state machine, and turn order,
//! ported from the oracle's `engine/game.py`. It does **not** yet hold movement, combat,
//! production, full status scoring/token choices, or agenda voting/effects. Its structural
//! game driver stops with typed metadata at those remaining decision boundaries.
//!
//! An earlier version of this crate had modules named for all of those. They were removed
//! rather than adapted: `rules.rs` returned `Ok(true)` from all 23 of its validators,
//! `tactical.rs` reported every system as one step from every other and moved no units, and
//! `effects.rs` gave every unit in the game a combat value of 1. They were written against
//! an invented model of TI4 — at one point a five-card strategy deck — and compiled, passed
//! tests, and read as implemented. See `plans/AUDIT_2026-08-11_PLAN_VS_TREE.md`.
//!
//! What replaces them is ported against a named oracle source with the oracle's own tests
//! mirrored, and what is not ported yet is absent rather than faked.

/// Test scaffolding: a small galaxy, and helpers that place units on it.
///
/// Compiled unconditionally rather than behind `#[cfg(test)]` or a feature, so sibling crates can
/// build a position to score without each inventing its own board. Two crates disagreeing about
/// what "a plain hub" means is how a passing test in one becomes a false negative in the other.
///
/// A feature was tried first and does not work: cargo resolves a dependency's features once for
/// the whole build, so a `dev-dependencies` entry cannot switch one on for a sibling's unit tests
/// without also switching it on everywhere. This crate is workspace-internal and never published,
/// so carrying the module is the cheaper of the two costs.
