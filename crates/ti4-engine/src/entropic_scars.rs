//! # Rules 2 and 4 are one predicate
//!
//! Rule 2 blocks an ability used *from* a scar; rule 4 blocks one used *into* one. Both are
//! [`abilities_usable`], which takes the acting unit's system and the system being acted on. Writing
//! them as two checks in each of the seven places a unit ability fires would mean seven chances to
//! implement half the rule.
//!
//! # Rules 2.1 to 2.3 need no code here
//!
//! They say what is *not* suppressed: printed card text keeps working, and text that merely
//! describes how to use a now-suppressed ability is inert because the ability it describes is gone.
//! Both fall out of suppressing the ability rather than the card.
