//! The faction plugin contract (M07-001).
//!
//! Ported from the oracle's `engine/faction_abilities/__init__.py`.
//!
//! A faction ability is a *query* the engine makes, not a reaction it waits for: how much to
//! shift a combat die, what the fleet limit is, whether this player may trade an action card.
//! None of the seven faction modules in the oracle imports the timing system, which is why this
//! layer needs no reactions to be useful.
//!
//! Registries are keyed by ability id and looked up through the player's faction, so an ability
//! belongs to whoever has the card rather than to a name checked at each call site. That matters
//! for coverage: [`unimplemented`] can then say which printed abilities nothing here answers,
//! and [`BLOCKED`] says which of those cannot be written yet and why — kept apart from the merely
//! unwritten so the numbers stay honest.
