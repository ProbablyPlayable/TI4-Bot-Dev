//! What an option would do, stated as fact (OBS-007a).
//!
//! A policy choosing between options can see what each one *is* — its id, its kind, its payload —
//! and not what it would *do*. "Produce a carrier" and "produce a destroyer" differ in cost, in
//! fleet supply, in capacity and in what the seat can afford afterwards, and none of that is in the
//! option. The consequence has to be re-derived by the network from the position, for every option,
//! every time.
//!
//! This module defines the type that carries it. It computes nothing: the deterministic helpers are
//! OBS-007b, the stochastic ones OBS-007c, and the per-class producers OBS-008.
//!
//! # Three rules the type enforces
//!
//! **Fail closed.** A preview that cannot be computed says so. There is no zero-valued default and
//! no "probably nothing": [`Outcome::Unknown`] carries a reason, and a reader that treats it as
//! "no change" is making that error visibly rather than inheriting it silently. This matters more
//! than it sounds — a shaping term fed a confident zero learns that the action is free.
//!
//! **Cannot mutate.** Every entry point takes `&GameState`. Previewing is a question, and a
//! question that can change the answer is not one. The borrow checker enforces this rather than a
//! convention anyone has to remember.
//!
//! **Bounded.** A preview is capped at [`MAX_DELTAS`] and says when it truncated. An option that
//! moves forty quantities produces a bounded summary that admits it is one, instead of a vector
//! whose width depends on the position.
//!
//! # Unknown is not Unavailable
//!
//! [`Outcome::Unavailable`] means the option cannot be taken — the engine would refuse it.
//! [`Outcome::Unknown`] means it can be taken and the consequence was not computable here. Folding
//! those together would teach a policy that anything unmodelled is illegal, which is both false and
//! self-reinforcing: it would stop choosing exactly the options nobody had got round to modelling.
