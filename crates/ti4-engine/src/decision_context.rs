//! Why the engine is asking this question (OBS-003a).
//!
//! A [`Choice`](crate::choice::Choice) today carries a player, a prompt string and a list of
//! options. Nothing in it says which rule raised the question, what kind of question it is, or what
//! is still owed from a decision already in progress. The learned router therefore recovers the
//! semantics from free prompt text, and `other` becomes a catch-all holding scoring, agenda riders,
//! exploration, transit, faction abilities and card effects together.
//!
//! The rule-dependency matrix measured what that costs: fourteen producers read law, agenda and
//! custodians state that reaches no feature at all, and the prompt — the one channel that currently
//! separates these questions — reaches the option-invariant part of the observation in only 1,753
//! of 3,678 decisions.
//!
//! This module defines the type. It does not populate producers, change any legal option set, or
//! touch replay: those are OBS-003b through OBS-003h.
//!
//! # Two things it carries that a prompt cannot
//!
//! **A stable subtype.** [`DecisionContext::subtype`] is a machine identifier chosen by the
//! producer, not a sentence. Rewording a prompt must never change how a decision is classified, and
//! today it can.
//!
//! **What is still outstanding.** Several decisions are one transaction spread over several
//! prompts, and a snapshot of the board between them does not say how much has already been paid or
//! produced. A seat that exhausted a four-influence planet toward a three-influence command token
//! holds one influence of credit that exists nowhere in the position; asking again without it
//! charged seven influence for two tokens. [`OutstandingConstraint`] is where that lives.
//!
//! # Visibility
//!
//! Every field here describes the question being put to one seat, so the whole record is visible to
//! that seat by construction. It is still redacted rather than assumed: [`DecisionContext::visible_to`]
//! answers what a *different* seat may see, because reviews, replays and any future observer of the
//! table read the same record.
