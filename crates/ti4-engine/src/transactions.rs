/// The asks that take something *from* the partner, paid in goods, commodities or paper.
///
/// Every shape the generator originally produced carried something to the partner and took payment
/// back: a note sold (`pn`), a card sold under Arbiters (`ac`), commodities swapped (`cc`, `ct`,
/// `tc`), support exchanged (`ss`). Nothing in the set asked for an asset the partner was holding,
/// so "will you sell me your Research Agreement" was not a rude offer — it was unsayable. Hacan
/// made that loudest, because the note worth having is the one across the table and the only price
/// its card had was one the partner might not hold.
///
/// Prices are not invented here. Each is the posted price that the same note carries when it is the
/// thing being sold (`note_option_price`), which is what lets the payer substitute the currency they
/// actually have — that half of the report was "deals often want trade goods as payment although
/// commodities would be available".
///
/// * `np{note}:{g}` — `g` of my trade goods for their note;
/// * `cp{note}:{c}` — the same price paid in my commodities;
/// * `pc{note}:{c}` — my note for `c` of their commodities, the same ask from the other chair;
/// * `nn{mine}>{theirs}` — one of my notes for one of theirs;
/// * `cn{card}>{note}` — an action card for their note, under the same 94.3 Arbiters gate as the
///   card sale (added in [`action_card_shape`], not here).
///
/// `>` separates the halves of a two-asset id. Token matching splits an option id on `|`, and `:`
/// already carries a price — and a note id contains `:` itself (`ra:jolnar`), so neither can divide
/// `nn` without making the note unreadable. This is also why commodities-for-a-note is `cp` and not
/// `pnc`: `pnc…` would be eaten by the `pn` branch above, which is a prefix test and not a grammar.
///
/// The note pairs are capped: both chairs can hold several notes and every ordered pair buries the
/// rest of the window in near-duplicates, so the four best nets go on the table in a fixed order.
