//! Movement legality for the tactical action.
//!
//! Ported from the oracle's `engine/movement.py`, whose rule list is quoted from the Living
//! Rules Reference rather than recalled:
//!
//! - **58.4a** a ship must end its movement in the active system
//! - **58.4b** it cannot move *through* a system containing another player's ships
//! - **58.4c** it cannot move at all if it started in another system containing one of its own
//!   faction's command tokens
//! - **58.4d** it may move through systems containing its own command tokens
//! - **58.4e** it may leave the active system and return, given move value
//! - **58.4f** it moves along adjacent systems, and the number of systems *entered* cannot
//!   exceed its move value
//! - **11.1** a ship cannot move through or into an asteroid field
//! - **86.1** a ship cannot move through or into a supernova
//! - **59.1** a ship can only move into a nebula if it is the active system, and (59.1a) cannot
//!   move through one
//! - **59.2** a ship that begins the Movement step in a nebula treats its move value as 1
//! - **41.1** a ship moving out of or through a gravity rift applies +1 to its move value, and
//!   (41.3) a rift may affect the same ship several times in one movement
//!
//! Gravity rifts make the budget path-dependent — a route through two rifts is worth two extra
//! movement — so reachability is a search rather than a distance comparison. The 41.2
//! destruction roll is a *consequence* of moving, not a legality question, and belongs to the
//! tactical action rather than here.
