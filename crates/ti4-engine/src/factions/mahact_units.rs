//! Mahact flagship (Arvicon Rex), Crimson Legionnaire I/II, Starlancer mech and the hero (Airo Shir
//! Aur). Everything else Mahact is in `mahact.rs`; the foreign tokens in the Mahact fleet pool are
//! read through `mahact::fleet_pool_owners`. Record: `plans/evidence/BF-mahact-units.md`.
//!
//! Card text (content corpus, latest printing):
//!
//! * Arvicon Rex, flagship: "During combat against an opponent whose command token is not in your
//!   fleet pool, apply +2 to the results of this unit's combat rolls."
//! * Crimson Legionnaire I: "After this unit is destroyed, gain 1 commodity or convert 1 of your
//!   commodities to a trade good."
//! * Crimson Legionnaire II (`cl2`): "After this unit is destroyed, gain 1 commodity or convert 1 of
//!   your commodities to a trade good. Then, place the unit on this card. At the start of your next
//!   turn, place each unit that is on this card on a planet you control in your home system."
//! * Starlancer, mech: "After a player whose command token is in your fleet pool activates this
//!   system, you may spend their token from your fleet pool to end their turn; they gain that token."
//! * Airo Shir Aur, hero (`mahacthero`): "ACTION: Move all units in the space area of any system to an
//!   adjacent system that contains a different player's ships. Space combat is resolved in that
//!   system. Neither player can retreat or resolve abilities that would move their ships. Then, purge
//!   this card."
//!
//! Routes:
//!
//! * Arvicon Rex is a roll bonus: `combat::effective_from` adds [`flagship_roll_bonus`] to the roll,
//!   which lowers the threshold. The opponent is the other side of the combat in the active system.
//! * The Legionnaires hang on `GROUND_FORCE_DESTROYED` (invasion, action cards, agendas). CL II's
//!   card is the faction mark [`card_key`] (a count); infantry are uncapped in `supply::plastic`, so a
//!   unit on the card is simply not on the board, which is what keeps it out of the reinforcements
//!   in every other reader. It comes back on the owner's `TURN_BEGAN`.
//! * The Starlancer is a window the game drives right after `SYSTEM_ACTIVATED` (where the Xxcha
//!   Nullification Field and the Mahact commander end a turn): [`offer_starlancer`], called from
//!   `Game` which then ends the turn as it does for them.
//! * The hero is delivered through [`leader_action`] / [`use_leader_timed`]; the move and the combat
//!   run inside the game's timing resolver (`combat::resolve_resolving`) so the combat opens its
//!   usual windows. Retreat, and Skilled Retreat, are barred by [`ship_movement_barred`].
