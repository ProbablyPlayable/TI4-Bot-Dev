//! The Council Keleres, in its three Tribuni variants: Keleres–Mentak (`keleresm`), Keleres–Xxcha
//! (`keleresx`) and Keleres–Argent (`keleresa`). The content models The Tribuni's setup choice as
//! three faction records with their own home systems, heroes and Rider note ids, so this file
//! registers three modules over one shared implementation. See `plans/evidence/BF-keleres.md`.
//!
//! Split for parallel work: this file holds the abilities (The Tribuni, Council Patronage, Law's
//! Order), the technologies, the breakthrough, the commander/agent and the variant plumbing;
//! `keleres_units.rs` holds the flagship, mech, the three heroes and the Keleres Rider.
//!
//! **One module carries the hooks.** The engine calls every module's hooks for every seat, so
//! three modules sharing one hook table would run each hook three times (three copies of every
//! timing ability, three offers of every component action). [`MODULE_M`] carries the table; the
//! other two variants register their claims only. Every hook decides from the seat's own faction
//! ([`is_keleres_faction`]), never from the module it was called through.
//!
//! Card texts (latest printing, `crates/ti4-content/content/*.json`):
//!
//! * The Tribuni: "During setup, choose an unplayed faction from among the Mentak, the Xxcha and The
//!   Argent Flight; take that faction's home system, command tokens and control markers.
//!   Additionally, take the Keleres Hero that corresponds to that faction." Implemented in
//!   `seating.rs` ([`crate::seating::validate_tribuni`]): the variant's base faction must be
//!   unplayed. The home system and hero are the variant record's own; command tokens are pool counts
//!   and control is per seat, so there is nothing further to take.
//! * Council Patronage: "At the start of the strategy phase: Replenish your commodities, then gain
//!   1 trade good."
//! * Law's Order: "At the start of any player's turn: You may spend 1 trade good or 1 commodity to
//!   treat all laws as blank until the end of that turn." ([`crate::laws::blanked`].)
//! * Agency Supply Network (`asn`): "Once per action, when you resolve a unit's PRODUCTION ability,
//!   you may resolve another of your unit's PRODUCTION abilities in any system."
//!   ([`crate::production::agency_supply_network`].)
//! * I.I.H.Q. Modernization (`iihq`): "You are neighbors with all players that have units or control
//!   planets in or adjacent to the Mecatol Rex system. Gain the Custodia Vigilia planet card and its
//!   legendary planet ability card. You cannot lose these cards, and this card cannot have an X or Y
//!   assimilator token placed on it." The breakthrough `keleresbt` has the same two clauses.
//! * Executive Order (`executiveorder`): "ACTION: Exhaust this card and draw the top or bottom card
//!   of the Agenda deck. Players immediately vote on this agenda as if you were the speaker; you can
//!   spend trade goods and resources on this agenda as if they were votes."
//! * Xander Alexin Victori III (`keleresagent`): "At any time: You may exhaust this card to allow any
//!   player to spend commodities as if they were trade goods."
//! * Suffi An (`kelerescommander`): unlock "Spend 1 trade good after you play an action card that has
//!   a component action"; the effect is in `borrowed_commanders.rs`.
//!
//! **Scoping decisions** (also in the evidence file):
//!
//! * Custodia Vigilia is placed in the Keleres' home system as a planet card
//!   (`planets::place`), gained the first step after the seat holds `iihq` or `keleresbt`
//!   ([`reconcile`], called by the driver before each step: tech and breakthrough reach a seat from
//!   many places and none announces it). It holds no units. Its legendary card is the planet's
//!   standing effect (SPACE CANNON 5 and PRODUCTION 3 for Mecatol Rex, two command tokens when
//!   another player scores Imperial's Mecatol point).
//! * The agent's "at any time" is offered where a player pays ([`offer_agent`]): once at the start of
//!   each payment window of a player who holds commodities, to the Keleres holder of a readied
//!   agent. The windows are `production::pay` and its variants (every spend that goes through the
//!   shared payment loop: unit production by ability, relics, exploration, Custodians, faction
//!   abilities), the production windows (tactical action, Warfare/Construction, abilities), the
//!   Technology card's paid research and Leadership's token purchase. When used, the payer's
//!   commodities count as trade goods for that window only ([`close_agent_window`]).
//! * Executive Order exhausts the card and draws the agenda ([`perform_component`]); the driver
//!   (`Game::begin_executive_order`) then reveals it and runs the vote through the ordinary agenda
//!   machinery, with the owner seated as speaker for the vote and a `VoteWindow` that lets the
//!   owner spend trade goods and resources as votes (`VoteWindow::with_spender`).
