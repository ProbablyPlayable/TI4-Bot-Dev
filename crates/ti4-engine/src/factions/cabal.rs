//! The Vuil'raith Cabal (`cabal`). See `factions/mod.rs` for the contract and
//! `plans/BASE_FACTIONS_PLAN_2026-10-02.md` for scope; the per-item record is
//! `plans/evidence/BF-cabal.md`.
//!
//! Card texts (latest printing, `crates/ti4-content/content/*.json`):
//!
//! * Devour: "Capture your opponent's non-structure units that are destroyed during combat."
//! * Amalgamation: "When you produce a unit: You may return 1 captured unit of that type to
//!   produce that unit without spending resources."
//! * Riftmeld: "When you research a unit upgrade technology: You may return 1 captured unit of
//!   that type to ignore all of the technology's prerequisites."
//! * The Terror Between (`cabal_flagship`): "Capture all other non-structure units that are
//!   destroyed in this system, including your own."
//! * Reanimator (`cabal_mech`): "When your infantry on this planet are destroyed, place them on
//!   your faction sheet; those units are captured."
//! * Dimensional Tear I (`cabal_spacedock`): "This system is a gravity rift; your ships do not
//!   roll for this gravity rift. Place a dimensional tear token beneath this unit as a reminder.
//!   Up to 6 fighters in this system do not count against your ships' capacity."
//! * Dimensional Tear II (`cabal_spacedock2`, tech `dt2`): the same with up to 12 fighters and
//!   PRODUCTION 7.
//! * Vortex (`vtx`): "ACTION: Exhaust this card to choose another player's non-structure unit in
//!   a system that is adjacent to 1 or more of your space docks. Capture 1 unit of that type from
//!   that player's reinforcements."
//! * The Stillness of Stars (`cabalagent`): "After another player replenishes commodities: You
//!   may exhaust this card to convert their commodities to trade goods and capture 1 unit from
//!   their reinforcements that has a cost equal to or lower than their commodity value."
//! * That Which Molds Flesh (`cabalcommander`): "When you produce fighter or infantry units: Up
//!   to 2 of those units do not count against your PRODUCTION limit." Unlock: "Have units in 3
//!   gravity rifts."
//! * It Feeds on Carrion (`cabalhero`): "ACTION: Each other player rolls a die for each of his
//!   non-fighter ships that are in or adjacent to a system that contains a dimensional tear. On a
//!   1-3, capture that unit. If this causes a player's ground forces or fighters to be removed,
//!   also capture those units. Then, purge this card."
//! * Crucible (`crucible`): "After you activate a system: Your ships do not roll for gravity
//!   rifts during this movement, apply an additional +1 to the move values of your ships that
//!   would move out of or through a gravity rift instead. Then, return this card to the Vuil'raith
//!   player."
//! * Al'Raith Ix Ianovar (`cabalbt`): "This breakthrough causes The Fracture to enter play
//!   without a roll, if it is not already in play. After this card enters play, move up to 2
//!   ingress tokens into systems that contain gravity rifts. Apply +1 to the MOVE value of each of
//!   your ships that start their movement in The Fracture."
//!
//! # Capture
//!
//! The Cabal does not destroy what it kills: it keeps it. Capture is shared engine state
//! (`supply::capture_from_board`, `supply::capture_from_reinforcements`, `supply::return_captured`,
//! rows in `Player::captured_units` as `(owner, unit type)`), so this module only decides which
//! destructions and which reinforcements the Cabal takes. `MODULE` claims an asset only once every
//! clause of that card is implemented and tested.
//!
//! ## Reanimator
//!
//! Reanimator is a unit trigger, not a leader: the text is on the mech card. The module claims
//! `cabal_mech` and registers a stateful ability on the engine's `GROUND_FORCE_DESTROYED` window,
//! gated by a condition, exactly as Arborec registers `Mitosis` on the same window. The hit is
//! applied before that window is announced, so the infantry is already off the board and cannot be
//! taken with `supply::capture_from_board` (which refuses a captor that is also the owner): the row
//! is written onto the Cabal's own sheet, which is the same representation every other capture
//! uses and the one `supply::captured_by` and `supply::captured_of` read.
