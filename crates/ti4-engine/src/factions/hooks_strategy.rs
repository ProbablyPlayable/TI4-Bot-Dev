//! Faction hooks for strategy cards, initiative and unit forms (`strategy.rs`, `strategy_cards.rs`, `supply.rs`, `production.rs`, `fleet.rs`): initiative order, strategy-card swaps, capture, mobile docks, dual-form units.
//!
//! Owned by one wave-B package at a time (`plans/BASE_FACTIONS_PLAN_2026-10-02.md`). Each
//! field is optional and called for every module; dispatch functions live here beside the
//! fields, iterate [`super::MODULES`] in order, and are what the shared engine calls. The rules
//! on `super::Hooks` (atomicity, ordering, ownership) apply. Tests install hooks with a
//! `#[cfg(test)] with_test_hooks(hooks, || ..)` that restores on panic, as in `hooks_combat.rs`.
//!
//! BF-00d-strategy adds three hooks; most of the package is plain state and API instead
//! (`plans/evidence/BF-00d-strategy.md`).
//!
//! | Hook | Card text it exists for | Call point |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`StrategyHooks::strategy_phase_ended`] | Naalu Telepathic, Gift of Prescience | `phase::advance_phase`, leaving the strategy phase, before initiative is read |
//! | [`StrategyHooks::secondary_waivers`] | Winnu Acquiescence | `strategy.rs`, the follower's secondary choice |
//! | [`StrategyHooks::secondary_waived`] | Winnu Acquiescence | `strategy.rs`, when that option is taken |
