//! Per-faction modules (BF-00a, `plans/BASE_FACTIONS_PLAN_2026-10-02.md`).
//!
//! Each faction being brought into scope lives in its own file here and declares one
//! [`FactionModule`]: what it implements, by printed id, and the [`Hooks`] the shared engine
//! calls. The shared modules (`faction_abilities`, `leaders`, `breakthroughs`, ...) dispatch to
//! every registered module from the hook functions they already expose, so a faction's code never
//! needs a branch at a call site and two factions never edit the same file.
//!
//! The six factions in scope before this plan (Sol, Hacan, Letnev, Xxcha, Jol-Nar, L1Z1X) stay
//! where they are: moving them would be behaviour-identical churn, and nothing new depends on it.
//!
//! **Ownership.** A hook is called for *every* player and every module, not only for the seat
//! playing that faction: a promissory note, a copied ability or a captured unit belongs to
//! whoever holds the card. Each hook checks its own condition and returns the neutral value
//! otherwise. Modules are visited in [`MODULES`] order, which is fixed, so dispatch never depends
//! on anything but that list.
//!
//! **Coverage.** The id lists in a module are claims that the printed text is implemented and
//! tested. [`ledger`] compares them, plus the pre-existing registries, against the content corpus
//! so a faction's gap is a list rather than an impression.
