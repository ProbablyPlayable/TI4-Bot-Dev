//! Faction hooks for hidden hands and card windows (`choice.rs`, `reactions.rs`, `action_cards.rs`): viewing hands, free-action discards, copying cards.
//!
//! Owned by one wave-B package at a time (`plans/BASE_FACTIONS_PLAN_2026-10-02.md`). Each
//! field is optional and called for every module; dispatch functions live here beside the
//! fields, iterate [`super::MODULES`] in order, and are what the shared engine calls. The rules
//! on `super::Hooks` (atomicity, ordering, ownership) apply. Tests install hooks with a
//! `#[cfg(test)] with_test_hooks(hooks, || ..)` that restores on panic, as in `hooks_combat.rs`.
//!
//! BF-00h-cards adds, besides one hook, three state-level routes that faction modules call:
//!
//! * **Reveals** ([`reveal`], [`reveal_hand`], [`revealed_to`], [`clear_reveals`],
//!   [`clear_reveals_from`]): "look at X's action cards / promissory notes / secret objectives".
//!   A reveal is a row in [`GameState::faction_marks`] (`cards:reveal:...`) naming the one seat that
//!   may see the cards. It is read back only through
//!   [`crate::choice::SeatObservation::revealed_action_cards`] and its two siblings, which answer
//!   for the seat the engine bound the view to; the public [`crate::choice::Observed`] has no
//!   accessor for it. The rows are empty unless a module reveals something, so games without
//!   faction modules serialise, hash and observe exactly as before.
//! * **Taking** ([`take_revealed_action_card`]): moves a card the taker has been shown, atomically.
//!   The choosing wrappers live in `action_cards.rs` ([`crate::action_cards::show_action_card`],
//!   [`crate::action_cards::take_from_revealed_hand`], [`crate::action_cards::look_at_hand_and_take`])
//!   because that is where the decision-delivery inventory scans.
//! * **Staged card events** ([`discard_chosen`], [`take_revealed_action_card`] stage
//!   `ACTION_CARD_DISCARDED` / `ACTION_CARD_TAKEN`): a hook holds a `TimingContext`, which has no
//!   resolver, so it cannot open a window itself. The effect is staged here and
//!   [`crate::reactions::announce_staged_card_events`] opens the windows.
//!
//! Typed events added by this package:
//!
//! | Event | Staged by | Announced by | Payload |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `ACTION_CARD_TAKEN` | [`take_revealed_action_card`] | `reactions::announce_staged_card_events` | `player` (taker), `from` (previous holder); no card id (private to taker and owner) |
//!
//! `ACTION_CARD_DISCARDED` already exists (payload `player`, `card`); a staged discard is announced
//! with the same payload, and only then does the card reach the discard pile and
//! `last_action_discarded` (Reverse Engineer's window reads both).
