//! The Naalu Collective (`naalu`). See `factions/mod.rs` for the contract and
//! `plans/BASE_FACTIONS_PLAN_2026-10-02.md` for scope; the per-item record is
//! `plans/evidence/BF-naalu.md`.
//!
//! Card texts (latest printing, `crates/ti4-content/content/*.json`):
//!
//! * Telepathic: "At the end of the strategy phase: Place the Naalu \"0\" token on your strategy
//!   card; you are first in initiative order."
//! * Foresight: "After another player moves ships into a system that contains 1 or more of your
//!   ships: You may place 1 token from your strategy pool in an adjacent system that does not
//!   contain another player's ships; move your ships from the active system into that system."
//! * Neuroglaive (`ng`): "After another player activates a system that contains 1 or more of your
//!   ships, that player removes 1 token from their fleet pool and returns it to their
//!   reinforcements."
//! * Hybrid Crystal Fighter II (`hcf2`): "This unit may move without being transported. Fighters
//!   in excess of your ships' capacity count as 1/2 of a ship against your fleet pool."
//! * Matriarch (flagship): "During an invasion in this system, you may commit fighters to planets
//!   as if they were ground forces. After combat, return those units to the space area."
//! * Iconoclast (`naalu_mech_te`, the Thunder's Edge printing `ti4_content::units::faction_unit`
//!   deals at `DEFAULT`): "DEPLOY: When another player gains a relic, place 1 mech on any planet
//!   you control."
//! * Gift of Prescience (`gift`): "At the end of the Strategy Phase: Place this card faceup in
//!   your play area and place the Naalu '0' token on your strategy card, you are the first in
//!   initiative order. The Naalu player cannot use their Telepathic faction ability during this
//!   game round. Return this card to the Naalu player at the end of the status phase."
//! * Z'eu (`naaluagent-te`, the Thunder's Edge agent `leaders::for_faction` deals at `DEFAULT`):
//!   "After any player's command token is placed in a system: You may exhaust this card to return
//!   that token to that player's reinforcements."
//! * M'aban (`naalucommander`): "You may look at your neighbors' hands of promissory notes and the
//!   top and bottom card of the agenda deck." Unlock: "Have ground forces in or adjacent to the
//!   Mecatol Rex system." (the unlock is shared code, `leaders::commander_unlocked`).
//! * The Oracle (`naaluhero`): "At the end of the status phase: You may force each other player to
//!   give you 1 promissory note from their hand. If you do, purge this card."
//! * Mindsieve (`naalubt`): "When you would resolve the secondary ability of another player's
//!   strategy card, you may give them a promissory note to resolve it without spending a command
//!   token."
//!
//! Every Naalu asset is claimed in [`MODULE`]; routes and tests are in `plans/evidence/BF-naalu.md`
//! and `BF-NAALU-TOKEN-PLACEMENTS.md` (Z'eu reacts to every `COMMAND_TOKEN_PLACED` the game emits
//! or stages).
