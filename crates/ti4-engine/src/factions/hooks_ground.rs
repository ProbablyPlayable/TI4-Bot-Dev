//! Faction hooks for invasion and ground combat (`invasion.rs`): bombardment, commitment, ground rounds, sustain, custodians.
//!
//! Owned by one wave-B package at a time (`plans/BASE_FACTIONS_PLAN_2026-10-02.md`). Each
//! field is optional and called for every module; dispatch functions live here beside the
//! fields, iterate [`super::MODULES`] in order, and are what the shared engine calls. The rules
//! on `super::Hooks` (atomicity, ordering, ownership) apply.
//!
//! # Typed events (BF-00c-ground)
//!
//! The invasion window emits these through `Resolving::emit`, so a faction's `timing_abilities`
//! can hang on them. All are *new* event types: no action card listens to any of them. Where the
//! payload carries `"system"`, `"planet"` and `"player"` they are plain strings.
//! They are emitted only by the live path (`InvasionWindow`); the synchronous test-only entry
//! points (`invasion::ground_combat`, `invasion::commit_ground_forces`, `invasion::resolve`
//! with no timing handle) emit nothing.
//!
//! | Event | Payload | When |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `GROUND_FORCE_SUSTAINED` | `system`, `planet`, `player` (owner), `unit` (type id), `cause` | A ground force used SUSTAIN DAMAGE to cancel a hit. |
//! | `GROUND_FORCE_DESTROYED` | `system`, `planet`, `player` (owner), `unit` (type id), `damaged` (bool), `cause` | A ground force was destroyed: by a hit in an invasion (live `InvasionWindow`, emitted at once), or by an action card / agenda effect (staged, see below). |
//! | `PLANET_CONTROL_GAINED` | `system`, `planet`, `player` (new controller), `previous_owner` (absent if uncontrolled) | A player gained control of a planet: invasion landing (emitted at once), or an action card / agenda / legendary / Thunder's Edge effect (staged, see below). |
//! | `GROUND_COMBAT_STARTED` | `system`, `planet`, `attacker`, `defender` | Before the first round of a ground combat on a planet. |
//! | `GROUND_COMBAT_ENDED` | `system`, `planet`, `attacker`, `defender`, `winner` (absent if both sides were wiped out), `control_changed` (bool) | After the last round, before the next planet. |
//! | `GROUND_COMMITMENT_FINISHED` | `system`, `player`, `planets` (array of strings) | The invader has finished committing ground forces. |
//! | `GROUND_COMBAT_ROLL_STEP_ENDED` | `system`, `planet`, `attacker`, `defender` | The "Roll Dice" step of a ground combat round is over (dice final, nothing assigned). A handler may call `combat::request_roll_replay` to play the step again (Nomad The Thundarian); not emitted by the synchronous test-only entry points. |
//!
//! `cause` is one of `ground_combat`, `harrow`, `space_cannon_defense`, `bombardment` (invasion),
//! or `action_card:<id>` / `agenda:<id>` for a card or agenda effect.
//!
//! # Staged events (BF-F1)
//!
//! A card, agenda or legendary effect holds a `TimingContext` or only a `GameState`, never a
//! resolver, so it cannot emit. Such an effect calls [`stage_ground_force_destroyed`] /
//! [`stage_planet_control_gained`], which write one row per event into the invisible
//! `faction_marks` namespace `private:#staged:ground:` (no seat is named `#staged`, so
//! `mark_visible_to` shows it to nobody, and `cards:staged:` parsing is not disturbed). The
//! coordinator drains them in staging order with [`announce_staged_events`] (beside
//! `combat::announce_staged_destructions`) after every action card play, agenda resolution,
//! component action and leader action; [`has_staged_events`] tells whether anything waits. Until
//! drained the rows are in-flight bookkeeping.
//! Hits from a ground-combat round are resolved for both sides first (42.2: simultaneous) and the
//! events of the round are then emitted in the order the hits were applied, invader's casualties
//! last; a handler therefore sees the board after the whole round.
//!
//! `control_changed` is *predictive*: control is established at the end of the invasion (49.5), so
//! it says "the winner is the invader and did not control the planet", which is exactly what 49.5
//! will then do.
