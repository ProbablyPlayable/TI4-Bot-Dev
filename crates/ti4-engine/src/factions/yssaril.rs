//! The Yssaril Tribes (`yssaril`). See `factions/mod.rs` for the contract and
//! `plans/BASE_FACTIONS_PLAN_2026-10-02.md` for scope; the per-item record is
//! `plans/evidence/BF-yssaril.md`.
//!
//! Card texts (latest printing, `crates/ti4-content/content/*.json`):
//!
//! * Stall Tactics: "ACTION: Discard 1 action card from your hand."
//! * Scheming: "When you draw 1 or more action cards: Draw 1 additional action card. Then, choose
//!   and discard 1 action card from your hand."
//! * Crafty: "You can have any number of action cards in your hand. Game effects cannot prevent
//!   you from using this ability."
//! * Transparasteel Plating (`tp`): "During your turn of the action phase, players that have
//!   passed cannot play action cards."
//! * Mageon Implants (`mi`): "ACTION: Exhaust this card to look at another player's hand of
//!   action cards. Choose 1 of those cards and add it to your hand."
//! * Y'sia Y'ssrila (flagship): "This ship can move through systems that contain other player's
//!   ships."
//! * Blackshade Infiltrator (mech): "DEPLOY: After you use your Stall Tactics faction ability, you
//!   may place 1 mech on a planet you control."
//! * Spy Net (`spynet`): "At the start of your turn: Look at the Yssaril player's hand of action
//!   cards. Choose 1 of those cards and add it to your hand. Then, return this card to the
//!   Yssaril player."
//! * So Ata (`yssarilcommander`): "After another player activates a system that contains your
//!   units: You may look at that player's action cards, promissory notes, or secret objectives."
//!   Unlock: "Have 7 action cards."
//! * Kyver, Blade and Key (`yssarilhero`): "ACTION: Each other player shows you 1 action card from
//!   their hand. For each player, you may either take that card or force that player to discard 3
//!   random action cards from their hand. Then, purge this card." Unlock: "Have 3 scored
//!   objectives."
//!
//! Ssruu copies every other seated faction's agent: the ACTION agents through
//! `leaders::borrowed_component_actions`, the timing agents through each faction's borrowed route
//! (census and acceptance audit in `plans/evidence/BF-SSRUU-SEATED-AGENT-CENSUS.md`).
//! Deepgloom Executable (`yssarilbt`) is implemented: consent, borrowed effects and the fixed-pair
//! transaction resolve through the staged-event flush at the beginning of every game step.
//!
//! **Hidden information.** Every look at another player's hidden cards goes through
//! `hooks_cards::reveal*`, which names the one seat that may see them, and is read back only
//! through that seat's `SeatObservation`. This module keeps no secret bookkeeping of its own, so it
//! writes no `private:<player>:` rows.
