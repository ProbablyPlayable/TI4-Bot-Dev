//! Empyrean flagship (Dynamo), mech (Watcher), agent (Acamar) and the Blood Pact / Dark Pact
//! promissory notes. Everything else Empyrean is in `empyrean.rs`.
//!
//! Card text (content corpus, latest printing):
//!
//! * Dynamo, flagship: "After any player's unit in this system or an adjacent system uses SUSTAIN
//!   DAMAGE, you may spend 2 influence to repair that unit."
//! * Watcher, mech: "You may remove this unit from a system that contains or is adjacent to
//!   another player's units to cancel an action card played by that player."
//! * Acamar, agent: "After a player moves ships into a system that does not contain any planets:
//!   You may exhaust this card: that player gains 1 command token."
//! * Blood Pact, promissory note: "ACTION: Place this card faceup in your play area. When you and
//!   the Empyrean player cast votes for the same outcome, cast 4 additional votes for that
//!   outcome. If you activate a system that contains 1 or more of the Empyrean player's units,
//!   return this card to the Empyrean player."
//! * Dark Pact, promissory note: "ACTION: Place this card faceup in your play area. When you give
//!   a number of commodities to the Empyrean player equal to your maximum commodity value, you
//!   each gain 1 trade good. If you activate a system that contains 1 or more of the Empyrean
//!   player's units, return this card to the Empyrean player."
//!
//! Routes:
//!
//! * Dynamo hangs on `SUSTAIN_DAMAGE_USED` (a ship in a space combat or space cannon step) and on
//!   `GROUND_FORCE_SUSTAINED` (a ground force: `combat.rs` and `invasion.rs` emit them after the unit
//!   is damaged). The repair is paid with `production::pay_seeing`, so the player chooses the
//!   planets exactly as for any influence spend, and nothing changes if they cannot pay.
//! * Watcher hangs on the WHEN window of `ACTION_CARD_PLAYED`, like Instinct Training, and cancels
//!   the event. Adjacency needs the map; without one only the mech's own system counts.
//! * Acamar hangs on `MOVEMENT_FINISHED` (one window per movement step, `ships_moved` > 0, not one
//!   per ship). The command token is placed through `strategy_cards::gain_tokens`, which lets the
//!   player who moved pick the pool.
//! * Blood Pact and Dark Pact wait in the holder's hand until their ACTION
//!   (`promissory::play_action_note`, offered by [`component_actions`] / [`perform_component`]) and go
//!   home when the holder activates a system holding Empyrean units
//!   (`promissory::spend_support_on_activation`). Blood Pact's votes are banked by `vote.rs`
//!   ([`blood_pact_votes`]); Dark Pact's trade goods by `transactions::resolve`
//!   ([`dark_pact_gains`]).
