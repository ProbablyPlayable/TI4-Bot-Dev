//! Faction hooks for production, placement, payment and action cards (`production.rs`, `action_cards.rs`, `laws.rs`, `supply.rs`).
//!
//! Owned by one wave-B package at a time (`plans/BASE_FACTIONS_PLAN_2026-10-02.md`). Each
//! field is optional and called for every module; dispatch functions live here beside the
//! fields, iterate [`super::MODULES`] in order, and are what the shared engine calls. The rules
//! on `super::Hooks` (atomicity, ordering, ownership) apply.
//!
//! Every hook defaults to the neutral value (identity on a fold, `false` on an "any", `0` on a
//! sum), so with every module empty the shared engine behaves exactly as before BF-00b-economy.
//! Hooks are called for every player and every module: check your own condition.
//!
//! Typed events added by this package (new names, never an existing type at a new place):
//!
//! | Event | Emitted by | Payload |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `UNITS_PRODUCED` | `production::ProductionWindow` when a use of PRODUCTION ends having produced 1+ unit | `player`, `system`, `source` ("production" / "ability"), `count`, `units` (array of `{unit_type, place}`; `place` is `"space"` or a planet id) |
//! | `ACTION_CARDS_DRAWN` | `action_cards::draw_announced` | `player`, `count` (actually drawn, extra draws included), `source` |
//! | `TRADE_GOODS_GAINED` | `supply::gain_trade_goods_announced` / `_via` | `player`, `amount` (actually gained), `source` |
