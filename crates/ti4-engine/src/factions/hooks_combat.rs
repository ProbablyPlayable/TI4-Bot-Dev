//! Faction hooks for space combat (`combat.rs`): rounds, hits, sustain, destruction, retreat, AFB.
//!
//! Owned by one wave-B package at a time (`plans/BASE_FACTIONS_PLAN_2026-10-02.md`). Each
//! field is optional and called for every module; dispatch functions live here beside the
//! fields, iterate [`super::MODULES`] in order, and are what the shared engine calls. The rules
//! on `super::Hooks` (atomicity, ordering, ownership) apply.
//!
//! BF-00c-space adds four hooks and the typed events they sit beside:
//!
//! | Hook | Card text it exists for | Call point |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`CombatHooks::produced_hits`] | Mentak Ambush, Yin Impulse Core, Yin Devotion | `CombatMoment` below |
//! | [`CombatHooks::may_sustain`] | Mentak flagship | every space SUSTAIN DAMAGE offer |
//! | [`CombatHooks::direct_hit_immune`] | Exotrireme II | the `direct_hittable` payload of `SUSTAIN_DAMAGE_USED` |
//! | [`CombatHooks::afb_excess`] | Argent Raid Formation | a barrage hit with no fighter left to take it |
//!
//! Events (emitted from `combat.rs`, consumed through `Hooks::timing_abilities`):
//! `SPACE_COMBAT_ROUND_ENDED` and `SPACE_COMBAT_ENDED`, and `SPACE_COMBAT_ROLL_STEP_ENDED`
//! (`system`, `round`, `attacker`, `defender`): the "Roll Dice" step is over, dice final and nothing
//! assigned; a handler may call `combat::request_roll_replay` to play the step again (Nomad The
//! Thundarian).
//!
//! Two hooks serve the Nomad: [`CombatHooks::grants_sustain`] (Quantum Manipulator, The Cavalry) and
//! [`CombatHooks::borrowed_stats`] (The Cavalry).
