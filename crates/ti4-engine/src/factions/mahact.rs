//! The Mahact Gene-Sorcerers (`mahact`). See `plans/evidence/BF-mahact.md`.
//!
//! Split for parallel work: this file holds the abilities (Edict, Hubris, Imperia), the foreign
//! command tokens in the fleet pool, the technologies, the agent, the commander unlock, the
//! Scepter of Dominion and the breakthrough; `mahact_units.rs` holds the flagship, Crimson
//! Legionnaire I/II, the Starlancer mech and the hero.
//!
//! Card texts (latest printing, `crates/ti4-content/content/*.json`):
//!
//! * Edict: "Other player's tokens in your fleet pool increase your fleet limit but cannot be
//!   redistributed." and, "When you win a combat: Place 1 command token from your opponent's
//!   reinforcements in your fleet pool if it does not already contain 1 of that player's tokens."
//! * Hubris: "During setup, purge your "Alliance" promissory note. Other players cannot give you
//!   their 'Alliance" promissory note."
//! * Imperia: "While another player's command token is in your fleet pool, you can use the ability
//!   of that player's commander, if it is unlocked."
//! * Genetic Recombination (`gr`): "You may exhaust this card before a player casts votes; that
//!   player must cast at least 1 vote for an outcome of your choice or remove 1 token from their
//!   fleet pool and return it to their reinforcements." (`vote.rs`.)
//! * Jae Mir Kan (`mahactagent`): "When you would spend a command token during the secondary
//!   ability of a strategic action: You may exhaust this card to remove 1 of the active player's
//!   command tokens from the board and use it instead."
//! * Il Na Viroset (`mahactcommander`): unlock "Have 2 other factions' command tokens in your
//!   fleet pool." The effect is shared code (`tactical.rs`, gated on
//!   `promissory::has_commander_ability`).
//! * Scepter of Dominion (`scepter`): "At the start of the strategy phase: Choose 1 non-home
//!   system that contains your units, each other player who has a token on the Mahact player's
//!   command sheet places a token from their reinforcements in that system. Then, return this
//!   card to the Mahact player."
//! * Vaults of the Heir (`mahactbt`): "ACTION: Exhaust this card and purge 1 of your technologies
//!   to gain 1 relic."
//!
//! **The foreign tokens.** A foreign command token in the Mahact fleet pool is a command token in
//! that pool: it counts toward the Mahact player's fleet supply (`fleet::limit`, under the Fleet
//! Regulations cap like any other token in the pool), and it leaves its owner's reinforcements for
//! as long as it is held ([`reinforcements`]; the owner cannot place or gain it meanwhile).
//! Returning it ([`remove_token`]) gives it back to its owner's reinforcements. It is not on the
//! Mahact sheet's own pools, so the Mahact player's `fleet_tokens` count never includes it, and
//! "cannot be redistributed" holds because redistribution works on that count.
//!
//! **Scoping decisions** (also in the evidence file):
//!
//! * The two Edict windows are the space combat win (`SPACE_COMBAT_WON`) and the ground combat win
//!   (`GROUND_COMBAT_ENDED` with a `winner`). Several space opponents cannot occur at this engine's
//!   table sizes, but if two are eligible the Mahact player picks.
//! * Hubris purges the Alliance at the deal (`promissory::deal`); the refusal to receive one is
//!   `promissory::may_receive`, checked where transactions generate and validate offers.
//! * "Command sheet" in the Scepter means the fleet pool tokens held here.
//! * A Scepter whose window comes resolves (no "may"); with no legal system it still returns.
