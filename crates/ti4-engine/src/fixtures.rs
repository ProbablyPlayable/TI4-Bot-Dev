//! Shared test fixtures.
//!
//! Every combat, movement and invasion module grew its own `arena`, `put` and `plain_systems`.
//! Beyond the duplication that cost a real bug twice: the one-ring geometry trap in
//! [`Hub::across`] was rediscovered independently in `movement.rs` and `tactical.rs`, because
//! each had written its own fixture and neither knew what the other had learned.
//!
//! Compiled unconditionally so sibling crates can use the same board; see the note on the module
//! declaration in `lib.rs` for why a cargo feature cannot do that job.
