//! Action cards played in a timing window rather than as a turn action (M06-016).
//!
//! Forty-two of the corpus's action cards carry the window `Action` and are played as a
//! component action (22.1); [`crate::action_cards`] handles those. The other hundred say things
//! like "After an agenda is revealed" or "At the start of a combat round", and nothing could
//! play them at all.
//!
//! The missing piece was never the stack. [`crate::timing`] implements all of it — WHEN and
//! AFTER windows, LRR 1.19/1.20 ordering, frequency, absolute "cannot" effects, depth-first
//! nesting. What was missing is that **nothing outside a test ever called `Resolver::register`**.
//! Machinery that is built, proven in isolation and connected to nothing is indistinguishable,
//! in an event count, from machinery that was never written.
//!
//! This module is the connection.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! One [`Ability`] per player per window, registered once when the game is seated, rather than
//! one per card in hand. Cards move constantly — drawn, played, discarded — and [`Resolver`]
//! deliberately has no unregister, because a "cannot" effect must not be removable (LRR 1.6).
//! Registering hands would mean either leaking stale abilities or building the removal path the
//! resolver refuses to have.
//!
//! So a reaction slot is standing furniture. Its *condition* asks whether this player currently
//! holds anything playable in this window, and its *effect* offers those cards and plays the
//! chosen one. The hand is read at resolution time, so it is always current.
//!
//! Frequency is [`Frequency::Unlimited`] rather than once-per-trigger. A player may hold two
//! cards for the same window, and 1.19's round-robin gives them a fresh opportunity after
//! anything else resolves; capping the slot would cap the player at one reaction per event,
//! which is not a rule.
//!
//! Windows are matched on the corpus's printed `window` text, not per alias. Twelve cards share
//! "After an agenda is revealed" and eight share "At the start of a combat round", so aliasing
//! the text is what keeps this a table rather than a hundred branches.
