//! Component limitations (LRR 31.4): you cannot field more plastic than you own.
//!
//! Ported from the oracle's `engine/supply.py`, which records what its absence looked like:
//! across eight measured games a single player held **18 carriers against the four in the box,
//! 14 PDS against six, and 10 dreadnoughts against five**. Every bot was obeying its scoring
//! perfectly while doing something impossible, which is why no amount of scoring analysis found
//! it — a player spotted it in one screenshot of a live table.
//!
//! **Fighters and infantry are not capped, and that is a rule rather than an omission.** The box
//! ships cardboard fighter and infantry tokens in 1× and 3× denominations exactly so those two
//! are never limited by plastic, and the rulebook says to substitute if you run out of tokens
//! too. The oracle records capping them as its own first mistake: "58 infantry against the twelve
//! in the box" was its headline, and 58 infantry is legal.
//!
//! **Counts are per player and keyed by base type.** `sol_carrier2` and `carrier` are the same
//! four pieces of plastic — an upgrade swaps the card, not the model — so the cap is read through
//! the unit's base type rather than its id, or a faction upgrade would silently double a fleet.
//!
//! 31.4's escape hatch, removing one of your own from the board to place it elsewhere, is
//! deliberately not modelled here. It is a real option and belongs in the production step as a
//! choice; [`remaining`] answers only "how many may still be placed".
