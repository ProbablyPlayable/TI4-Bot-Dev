//! Breakthrough abilities (Thunder's Edge), for the six trained factions.
//!
//! A breakthrough is a faction card gained through an expedition. `thunders_edge` grants it; this
//! is what having it *does*.
//!
//! > **4.** A breakthrough has 1 or more abilities, and a synergy.
//! >
//! > **4.1.** If a breakthrough has a passive ability and an exhaust ability, the passive ability
//! > always remains in effect, even when the breakthrough is exhausted.
//! >
//! > **4.2.** If a breakthrough has an exhaust ability, the synergy ability always remains in
//! > effect, even when the breakthrough is exhausted.
//! >
//! > **6.** A breakthrough itself is not a technology; it alone cannot be used to meet a
//! > prerequisite when researching a technology, nor can it alone be used to meet the technology
//! > requirement of an objective.
//!
//! Rule 6 holds by construction: a breakthrough lives in `Player::breakthrough`, and every count of
//! owned technologies reads `Player::technologies`. The test here exists to keep that true.
//!
//! The synergy half of every breakthrough is in [`crate::synergy`]. This module is the printed
//! abilities, registered per faction so [`unimplemented`] can say which are still missing — the same
//! pattern the rest of the engine uses for content.
//!
//! ## The six
//!
//! | faction | breakthrough | ability | here |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | letnev | Gravleash Maneuvers | move values levelled; +X in space combat | movement done, combat bonus outstanding |
//! | xxcha  | Archon's Gift | resources and influence are interchangeable | done |
//! | l1z1x  | Fealty Uplink | gaining a planet places infantry equal to its influence | done |
//! | sol    | Bellum Gloriosum | free ground/fighters with a capacity ship | done |
//! | hacan  | Auto-Factories | a fleet token for producing 3+ non-fighter ships | done |
//! | jolnar | Specialist Compounds | exhaust a specialty planet instead of paying to research | outstanding |
