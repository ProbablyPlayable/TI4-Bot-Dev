//! Bounded profile with raw samples (M09-019b).
//!
//! The first real component breakdown of per-decision cost on the post-rules tree. MLP plan §2
//! quotes ~450 µs/decision *inferred from an aggregate training log*; this module measures the
//! three components — engine stepping, feature extraction, model scoring — under the fixed
//! M00-012 protocol (`plans/evidence/M00-012{,a,b,c,d,e}.md`) instead of inferring them.
//!
//! # Protocol conformance (predeclared in `plans/M09-019b_BOUNDED_PROFILE_FEATURE_INVENTORY.md`)
//!
//! - 10 unmeasured warmup iterations per workload, each passing its semantic gate, then a
//!   five-second idle before timed samples begin (M00-012a).
//! - 30 timed samples per workload, none discarded; monotonic elapsed nanoseconds only
//!   (M00-012b); fresh game/workload state per iteration; seeds from the manifest constants
//!   below, never ambient entropy.
//! - Single worker; no power-plan, priority, or affinity change by the runner (M00-012c).
//! - Variance thresholds fixed in advance from M00-012e for the single-core game / policy
//!   scoring classes: stdev/mean ≤ 5% and (p95 − p50)/median ≤ 10%. A failed threshold triggers
//!   one fresh repeat run. Both reports are retained and classified `unstable` if either passes,
//!   or `rejected_variance` if both fail.
//! - One M00-012d schema report per retained run, raw samples included, atomically published as
//!   one complete campaign under gitignored `out/profiles/`; canonical sha256 + summary committed.
//!
//! # The semantic gate is the honest part
//!
//! A timing number means nothing if the workload did not run the shape it was asked for:
//!
//! - **W1 (engine)** plays one *complete* game per sample: on this engine every full game ends
//!   by objective-deck exhaustion at round 9, so completion is the workload's natural shape. A
//!   sample that errors or hits the safety bounds ran less work and fails the gate.
//! - **W2/W3 (feature/model)** replay to one fixed production-head choice; the captured position
//!   must be identical across every iteration (same step index, same option ids), which makes
//!   replay determinism part of the gate rather than an assumption.
//!
//! # No optimization bundled
//!
//! This module is measurement code only. It changes no engine, feature-construction, or
//! inference behavior to improve a number (the row says "no optimization bundled").
