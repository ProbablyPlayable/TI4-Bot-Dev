//! Recompute the behavioural bounds under the current tree, for a versioned re-baseline.
//!
//! Prints old and new side by side so the pair can be recorded in `plans/evidence/M08-021.md`,
//! which the re-baseline discipline in `crate::behavior` requires. It changes nothing: moving the
//! bounds is a source edit somebody reviews, not something a tool does.
//!
//! Uses `recompute_bound`, the same derivation the recorded values came from — the bootstrap draws
//! and seed are constants in `behavior`, and changing either is itself a re-baseline event.
