//! Measure a bundle's stage-1 opening clearance, at a fixed temperature, on held-out maps.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `ppo_update` prints a clearance table, and that table is **training data**: it is tallied from
//! the self-play rollouts the update was computed from, on the training pool, at the training
//! temperature. Three properties make it useless for comparing runs against each other.
//!
//! - It is sampled at whatever temperature the run trains at. A policy scores higher at 0.25 than
//!   at 1.0 because the softmax is sharper, so a 1.0 run and a 0.25 run reporting the same figure
//!   are not equally good. A temperature sweep read off those tables compares the measuring
//!   instrument, not the policies.
//! - It is measured on `full_np8_12_train.json`, the maps the policy is being fitted to.
//! - It moves with the batch: sixteen seeds, in a window ten updates wide.
//!
//! This tool fixes all three: one temperature chosen by the operator regardless of how the bundle
//! was trained, the **Validation** pool, and a seed range the caller holds constant across every
//! bundle it compares.
//!
//! # What it measures
//!
//! Exactly what `ppo_update` tallies -- `episode.cleared` and
//! `episode.final_progress.victory_points` from `play_with_decider_factory`, per seat, against
//! `opening::DEFAULT_REQUIREMENT`. It shares that path deliberately: a re-implementation of the bar
//! would be a second definition of the thing being measured, and the two would drift.
//!
//! Bots are seated **without** `recording_ppo`. Recording stores the sparse features of every legal
//! option at every decision, which is what the importance ratio needs and what made a
//! non-progressing game allocate 53 GB. An evaluation needs none of it.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --release -p ti4-mlp --example clearance_eval -- \
//!   --bundle out/checkpoints/run-028/checkpoint-60672 --temperature 0.25 --seeds 400
//! ```
//!
//! Inference is CPU-only under 7.1, so this needs no GPU and can run beside a training job.
