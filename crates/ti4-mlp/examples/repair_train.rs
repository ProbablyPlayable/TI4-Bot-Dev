//! Train on decisions that were demonstrated wrong, and measure whether it helps.
//!
//! One process, because the labels expire. Whether substituting an action clears depends on the
//! policy that plays the rest of the round, so a rescue set collected against one policy is stale
//! for the next. Each round therefore re-collects failures, re-enumerates repairs against the
//! *current* weights, trains, and measures.
//!
//! ```text
//! collect failures (Train pool, greedy)
//!   -> enumerate single-decision repairs, exhaustively
//!   -> build preference samples at repairing indices
//!   -> train  L = (1/N) Σ (1/|C|) Σ softplus(s_failed − s_clearing)
//!   -> measure greedy clearance (Validation pool)
//!   -> keep the best weights, regenerate, repeat
//! ```
//!
//! # Why the measurement is separate from everything else
//!
//! Failures are collected on the **Train** pool and clearance is measured on the **Validation**
//! pool, with role guards on both. The training signal and the number that decides whether it
//! worked never come from the same maps.
//!
//! Evaluation is greedy. Training at a temperature rescales the logits, so a fixed non-zero
//! evaluation temperature is not a fixed scale across policies; `argmax(s) = argmax(s/c)` is the
//! only reading that survives that, and it is what the target is stated in.
//!
//! # The safeguard
//!
//! This is an auxiliary objective run on its own, with no PPO term to hold the policy in place, so
//! the guard against drift is empirical: a small step size, held-out clearance after every epoch,
//! and the best weights kept rather than the last. The previous attempt at failure-directed
//! training regressed 2.2 points and would have been caught by exactly this
//! (`339f42d`) — it was, in fact, and reported honestly.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --release -p ti4-mlp --example repair_train -- \
//!   --bundle out/checkpoints/sweep-A-250/checkpoint-14476 --rounds 3 --out out/checkpoints/repair
