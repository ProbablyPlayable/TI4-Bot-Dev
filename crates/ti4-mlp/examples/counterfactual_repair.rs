//! Which single decision, changed, would have cleared a failed opening?
//!
//! # The question
//!
//! For a failed line `a_0 .. a_n`, replay `a_0 .. a_{i-1}` exactly, substitute one legal alternate
//! at index `i`, and let the seat play on under its own policy. If that clears, index `i` is
//! *causally* implicated:
//!
//! ```text
//! P(clear | do(a_i = a'))
//! ```
//!
//! This is not what the previous attempt at failure-directed training measured. `rescue_imitation`
//! sampled the whole line at temperature 2.5 and cloned the first decision where the rescue
//! diverged. At 2.5 a rescue diverges almost immediately, so "first divergence" collapsed onto
//! decision zero: two thirds of its training targets were the strategy card pick, credited for an
//! outcome twenty decisions later. Held out, it cost 2.2 points and every faction regressed
//! (`339f42d`). The fix recorded there is this: stop *finding* the divergence by sampling, and
//! *impose* it one index at a time.
//!
//! # Why this is affordable
//!
//! `failure_census` priced it. A failed seat-game runs 52 decisions and 251 alternates, at 128
//! games a second — about 22 minutes for a full enumeration of every failure a policy produces in
//! 10,800 seat-games. So the enumeration is exhaustive. Nothing is capped and nothing is sampled,
//! which is what keeps the `do()` semantics exact rather than approximate.
//!
//! # What makes the replay sound
//!
//! - **Greedy.** At the evaluation temperature the policy is effectively deterministic, so the
//!   prefix replays to the same position every time. A stochastic prefix would make "everything
//!   else held fixed" false, which is the whole claim.
//! - **The other five seats are never touched.** They play their own policy on their own streams.
//!   Perturbing them would change the contention the failing seat faced, and a position cleared
//!   against different opposition is a different position.
//! - **Only the substituted decision is imposed.** After index `i` the seat decides for itself. The
//!   state has diverged, so it is answering *different* questions from the ones it answered in the
//!   original line — "replaying its actions" after the intervention would not be a continuation of
//!   anything.
//! - **The option list is checked, not assumed.** If the number of options at index `i` differs
//!   from what pass one recorded, the prefix did not reproduce and the job is refused rather than
//!   silently substituting into a different decision.
//!
//! # What a repair does and does not prove
//!
//! That this alternate, followed by the policy's own play, cleared. Not that it is the uniquely
//! best action, and not that the original was the only mistake. That is exactly why the intended
//! consumer is a *preference* target -- rank the repair above the action that failed -- rather than
//! a one-hot label asserting the repair is correct and every other option wrong.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
