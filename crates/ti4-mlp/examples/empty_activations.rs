//! What actually happens after each activation (M10 behaviour diagnostic).
//!
//! Activating a system costs a command token from a pool of three, and the token stays there for
//! the rest of the round. An activation that moves nothing in and produces nothing has spent that
//! token for no board change. It is not illegal, and occasionally it is even deliberate, but a
//! policy doing it often is spending the resource that limits how many systems it can take.
//!
//! Two distinct faults hide behind "activated and nothing happened", and the aggregates this
//! project has trusted before could not tell them apart:
//!
//! - **unreachable**: the movement step offered no ship at all, so nothing *could* move in. The
//!   seat picked a destination outside its own reach.
//! - **declined**: ships were offered and the seat chose to finish movement anyway.
//!
//! The first is a targeting failure, the second a valuation failure, and they want different
//! fixes. This counts them separately, per faction, and reports what share of activations ended
//! with no unit moved and nothing produced.
