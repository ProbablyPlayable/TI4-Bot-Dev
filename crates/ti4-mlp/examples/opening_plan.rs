//! Does the policy follow the opening plan, and if not, which step does it miss?
//!
//! The clearance report says *which component of the bar* came up short. That is not the same as
//! which decision went wrong, and the difference matters: "77.8% of failures missed planets" is
//! consistent with a dozen different mistakes.
//!
//! The plan for a seat that already holds two capacity ships and three ground forces is short:
//!
//! 1. activate a **two-planet** system and carry at least two ground forces there;
//! 2. activate a **different one-planet** system and carry at least one;
//! 3. build something — `units_gained` is measured against setup, so landing infantry that already
//!    existed does not satisfy it.
//!
//! Three planets across three systems, plus a unit. This measures adherence to that shape, per
//! faction, split by whether the seat cleared.
//!
//! # What is measured, and how
//!
//! Activations are recorded at the decision, by a wrapper that delegates and writes down what it
//! was asked — an activation option's id *is* its destination system. Planet counts come from the
//! board, because how many planets a tile has is a property of the tile and not of the game.
//!
//! The unit step needs no instrumentation: `Opening::units_ok` already reports it.
//!
//! Sending both capacity ships to one system is the concentration failure measured in
//! F-M10-034-C2, and it appears here as a seat that activated only one tile, or two tiles that
//! cannot supply three planets between them.
