//! MLP PPO (M10-034), per MLP plan §6.3.
//!
//! # The two properties that fail quietly
//!
//! §6.3 says of the advantage: *"Two properties, both of which have to be stated or they will be got
//! wrong."* Both are the same shape of bug — the run trains, the numbers move, the objective is not
//! the one that was intended — so both are asserted here rather than described.
//!
//! **Detached.** `A = (returns − V_rollout).detach()`. Without the detach the actor loss
//! back-propagates through the advantage into the critic, and the policy gradient acquires a term
//! that trains `V` to make its own surrogate look better. [`Batch::advantages`] holds no graph at
//! all, which is why `advantages_are_frozen_and_normalised_once` can check it directly.
//!
//! **Frozen across epochs.** `A` is computed once from the behaviour weights and reused unchanged
//! for all four epochs, and normalised at that same moment. Recomputing it per epoch would move the
//! objective underneath the ratio `r`, so the importance-sampling correction the clip exists to
//! bound would no longer refer to a fixed target; re-normalising per epoch reintroduces exactly the
//! drift the freeze removes.
//!
//! The critic still trains every epoch, against `returns`, through its own head — the path that is
//! *supposed* to update it.
//!
//! # Ragged option sets
//!
//! Decisions have different numbers of legal options, so a minibatch's logits are flattened with
//! segment offsets rather than padded to a rectangle. §6.3: "so padding can never enter
//! softmax/entropy". A padded row would contribute a real probability to a softmax over options
//! that do not exist, and would add its own term to the entropy bonus — a policy could then raise
//! its entropy reward by being uncertain about options it was never offered.
