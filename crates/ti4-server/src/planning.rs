//! another game copy can follow the same plan later.
//!
//! An answer marked "consumed" has been used in this attempt. It does not mean
//! its changes have been accepted. To make a batch all-or-nothing, the caller
//! must try the whole batch on a game copy and throw that copy away if any part
//! fails. Keep the original game and full list of answers for another attempt.
//! That batch handling is not implemented here.
//!
//! Check replay progress after each engine step, even if the step reports success:
//! the engine sometimes catches an answer error and continues. Once replay fails,
//! it refuses to answer any more questions, but it cannot undo earlier changes.
//! A planning copy must never replace the live game. This code also does not stop
//! the engine from rolling dice or revealing hidden information. The [`runner`]
//! module adds that publication boundary around these adapters and an ordinary
//! disposable engine fork.
