//! Game state.
//!
//! Ported from the oracle's `engine/state.py`. There, state is an immutable frozen
//! dataclass and every change returns a new `GameState`. Here it is an owned value with
//! `&mut self` mutators and `Clone`: a caller that needs the old state keeps a clone, which
//! is the same guarantee without rebuilding the whole structure on every field write.
//!
//! Two idioms from the oracle are load-bearing and are carried over deliberately.
//!
//! **Duration-scoped effects store the sequence number they were played in**, not a flag.
//! `combat_bonus_round`, `move_bonus_activation`, `free_production_use` and the rest hold a
//! value of the matching monotonic counter on [`GameState`]. A flag would have to be cleared
//! by some later step, and a combat or a tactical action can end down several paths — one
//! side wiped out, a retreat — so the flag leaks out of the paths that do not clear it. A
//! sequence number lapses on its own the moment the counter moves.
//!
//! **Equality ignores the derived and bookkeeping fields.** See [`GameState`]'s `PartialEq`.
