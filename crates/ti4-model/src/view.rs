//! Redacted views of the game state.
//!
//! Some things in TI4 are private: the action cards in your hand, the secret objectives you
//! hold. Everything else — the board, who controls what, how many victory points everyone
//! has — is open information that any player may read.
//!
//! A view is a [`GameState`] with the private parts of *other* players **replaced rather
//! than removed**. A hand of four unknown cards becomes four [`HIDDEN`] markers, so its
//! *size* stays visible, which is correct: at a real table you can see how many cards
//! somebody holds without seeing which.
//!
//! Replacing rather than deleting matters for a second reason. Every existing query keeps
//! working against a view, so nothing has to learn about redaction to be safe. Code that
//! only counts is unaffected; only code that inspects a specific card sees the marker, and a
//! marker is not a valid id, so it matches nothing in the content corpus.
//!
//! The seam is deliberately narrow. A bot is handed a redacted state, but asks the *real*
//! engine to enumerate its legal options, because legality depends on facts the bot is not
//! entitled to compute for itself.
