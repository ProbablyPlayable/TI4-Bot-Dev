//! The engine behind a wasm boundary, for local play in `web2/`.
//! See `README.md` for the measurements.
//!
//! The boundary is the plain C ABI rather than `wasm-bindgen`. An export returns a status: zero
//! or more is the length of a JSON result, less than zero is the negated length of an error text.
//! Either is read from the response buffer, whose address never changes ([`ti4_response_ptr`]).
//!
//! # Memory
//!
//! This crate does not allocate for its own data: results and the update for the host (the view
//! of the asked seat and its choice) are written straight into the fixed buffers of [`buffer`]. What still allocates
//! here is what the interfaces of the engine and of `ti4-view` ask for (owned ids, the decider
//! box, the copy of the state, a projected view) and the text of an error.
