//! The galaxy: systems, planets, and adjacency.
//!
//! Systems come from the corpus verbatim, so [`System`] is a thin typed view over a record
//! rather than a re-modelling of one. Anomaly flags, wormholes, and planet lists are read
//! straight from the data, which is what keeps "adding Thunder's Edge tiles is a
//! re-extraction, not a code change" true.
//!
//! Adjacency is the six hex neighbours *plus* wormhole pairing: in TI4 two tiles sharing a
//! wormhole kind are adjacent however far apart they sit. It is derived on demand rather
//! than stored, so no cached neighbour list can drift from the placement.
//!
//! Hyperlanes are not modelled. The corpus marks a tile `isHyperlane` but carries no path
//! data, and guessing the paths would produce adjacency that is wrong in a way tests would
//! not catch. [`Galaxy::hyperlanes`] lists them so a caller can see what is excluded.
