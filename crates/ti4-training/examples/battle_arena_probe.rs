//! ARENA-001 probe: does a pitched battle run outside a full game?
//!
//! The first executable unit of `plans/BATTLE_ARENA_AGENT_HANDOFF_2026-09-16.md`, cut down to the
//! one assumption nothing else can be built on: that a minimal valid engine context plus two
//! fleets in a system drives the real retained `CombatWindow` to an outcome, reproducibly, with a
//! declared combat policy answering casualties and sustains.
//!
//! Deliberately not here yet: the scenario schema, split families, seed panels, upgrades, faction
//! effects, cards, and any dataset. Those follow once this shape is proven. Nothing is written to
//! disk.
//!
//! No second rules implementation: the engine resolves the fight. This only supplies the position
//! and answers the choices.
