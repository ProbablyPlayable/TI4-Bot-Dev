//! Why is one home slot so much worse than the others?
//!
//! Clearance pooled over factions differs by physical seat far more than it differs by faction, so
//! whatever the seats are is a larger effect than which faction plays them. Since home systems are
//! placed into map slots by seat index, seat N is map slot N, and this counts what each slot can
//! actually reach: planets within one and two hexes, which is what a one-round opening can take.
