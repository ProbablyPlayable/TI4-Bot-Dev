//! The fixed teacher corpus (M10-031), per MLP plan §6.1.
//!
//! # What is captured
//!
//! The r6 champions play the training map pool for seeds `202_608_210..202_608_338` × six
//! rotations — 768 games — and every **non-forced** decision is recorded with:
//!
//! - its deterministic order, faction and head;
//! - every legal option id;
//! - the sparse factual actor vector per option;
//! - the option-free factual critic vector;
//! - the complete teacher probability vector;
//! - the accepted four-round return the critic warm-up reads.
//!
//! # Forced choices are filtered, and that is not an optimisation
//!
//! A decision with one legal option carries no information about preference: the teacher's
//! probability for it is 1.0 whatever the teacher believes, so a KL term over it is identically
//! zero and it contributes nothing but weight. Worse, forced decisions are not uniformly
//! distributed across heads — they cluster in the mechanical ones — so keeping them would tilt the
//! per-faction mean §6.1 asks for toward whichever head happens to be most often forced.
//!
//! # Hidden information
//!
//! Capture runs inside `choose_seeing`, from the engine-bound `SeatObservation`. §6.1: "Capture is
//! built only from the acting seat's authorized view; it does not retain a raw omniscient state as
//! a shortcut." That is enforced by the same types M09-021 and M09-027 established rather than by
//! this module's care — the critic extractor takes the capability and nothing else.
//!
//! # The split is by seed, never by decision
//!
//! `202_608_210..202_608_306` trains, `202_608_306..202_608_338` validates. Splitting by decision
//! would put decisions from the *same game* on both sides, and a model that memorised a position
//! would score as one that generalised. Any overlap between the clusters is a hard error, checked
//! rather than assumed.
