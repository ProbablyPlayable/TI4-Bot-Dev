//! Proximal policy optimisation over retained trajectories.
//!
//! The difference from [`crate::gradient`] is not the advantage -- it is that a batch is used
//! more than once. REINFORCE simulates 96 games, takes one gradient step, and throws the games
//! away; simulation is essentially all of this project's compute, so that one step is the entire
//! return on the expensive part. PPO keeps the batch and takes `epochs` steps from it, holding
//! the update trustworthy with an importance ratio and a clip rather than with a fresh sample.
//!
//! Two facts about this codebase make that cheap:
//!
//! * every option's feature vector is already recorded on the trajectory, so a later epoch
//!   re-reads features rather than re-extracting them, and re-simulates nothing;
//! * the behaviour policy's probability for every option is recorded too, so the ratio needs no
//!   separate bookkeeping.
//!
//! And one fact makes the baseline simpler here than in the general case: **returns do not depend
//! on the policy.** They are a function of the episode, which is fixed once the batch is played.
//! So the centring mean and the scale are computed once, before the first epoch, and every epoch
//! shares them. Only the ratio and the expectation `sum_o p_o phi_o` move.
