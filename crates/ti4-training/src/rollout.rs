//! Playing games with learned policies, and reducing them to episodes (M10-012).
//!
//! Ported from the oracle's `_rollout` in `tools/train_stage1_policy_gradient.py`.
//!
//! One rollout seats a learned policy per faction, plays a bounded game, and hands back one
//! [`Episode`] per seat: the decisions that seat took, the progress at each of them, and how the
//! opening ended. [`crate::reward::returns`] turns an episode into the number each decision is
//! credited with.
//!
//! # Bounded on purpose
//!
//! A blank policy plays uniformly at random and a random game can spend a long time achieving
//! nothing, so a rollout is capped in rounds and in steps. Stage 1 cares only about round one and
//! runs one round; Stage 2 runs a short horizon. Both are far below the length of a decided game,
//! which is the point: the training signal is what a policy produced early, not who eventually won
//! a game nobody has yet learned to win.
