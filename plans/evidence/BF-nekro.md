# BF-nekro (part A)

Part B (flagship The Alastor, mech Mordred, agent, hero, commander unlock, Thunder's Edge technologies
`nekroc4y` / `nekroc4r`) is `factions/nekro_units.rs`. This file: abilities, Valefar Assimilators X/Y,
the technology-rights predicate, the Z token helpers and Antivirus.

## How it works

* **Propagation.** Every research route (Technology primary and secondary, action cards, agents, the
  waiver routes) ends in `technology::complete_research`. For a Nekro it records one pending
  replacement (`nekro:propagation:<player>` count) and returns without gaining the technology or firing
  anything that triggers on research. `Game::announce_gains` (game.rs, 5 lines) emits one
  `PROPAGATION_RESEARCH` per pending replacement at the next step; the mandatory Nekro ability places
  3 tokens through `strategy_cards::gain_tokens` (the owner picks each pool). Any resource payment a
  route took before the research stays paid (Rules question 3).
* **Technological Singularity.** `*_COMBAT_STARTED` writes `nekro:ts:<system>[|<planet>]` =
  `<opponent>|open`, `*_COMBAT_ENDED` removes it, the first destruction of the opponent's unit in that
  combat (`SHIP_DESTROYED` with `during_space_combat`, `GROUND_FORCE_DESTROYED` with
  `cause = ground_combat`) offers the gain and flips the mark to `used`. Optional. A faceup
  Antivirus held by the opponent bars it.
* **Galactic Threat.** After `AGENDA_REVEALED`, once per round (`nekro:threat_phase:<player>`), the
  Nekro may predict (`action_cards::predicted_outcome`, auto when there is one outcome), stored as
  `nekro:threat:<player>` = `<agenda_seq>|<outcome>`. After `AGENDA_RESOLVED`, a matching outcome (and
  no Deadly Plot discard) offers a gain from the players in `agenda_votes` who voted that outcome.
  Mandatory once predicted. `VoteWindow::new` drops the Nekro from the vote order (Elder Qanoj's
  exception for a seat with it is kept).
* **Gaining another player's technology** (`nekro::take_from`, shared by Singularity and Threat): one
  choice listing `gain|<source>|<tech>` (a technology the Nekro lacks; another faction's faction
  technology is excluded, 90.11), `x|`/`y|<source>|<faction tech>` (Valefar card owned, token free,
  technology not already carrying a token), and `z|` (never generated, see below).
* **Valefar X/Y.** The token is `Player::assimilated_technologies["vax"|"vay"]` (existing model field,
  "not compared"). `nekro::assimilated_card` is live only while the Nekro owns the card and another
  player still owns the technology. `technology::has_technology_text(state, player, tech)` = owns it, or
  assimilated. Assimilated text never enters `Player::technologies`, so it counts for no prerequisite,
  colour, upgrade or objective. Exhaustion goes to the Valefar card
  (`technology_text_ready`, `exhaust_technology_text`). Helpers for part B:
  `nekro::assimilators_with_tokens(state, player)` (the commander's "counts only if its X or Y token is
  on a technology"), `nekro::assimilated_card`.
* **Z token.** `nekro::z_assimilated_faction`, `nekro::z_assimilated_flagship(state, nekro) ->
  Option<unit id>`. Both exist; the second returns `Some` only for flagships in
  `nekro::LENDABLE_FLAGSHIPS`, which is empty (every other flagship's text is delivered by hooks that
  compare the unit type with their own id; no shared hook lets the Nekro flagship stand in). So the Z
  option is never offered and `nekrobt` is not claimed. To claim it later: make each lendable
  flagship's hooks also accept the Nekro flagship when `z_assimilated_flagship` names theirs, then add
  its unit id to `LENDABLE_FLAGSHIPS`.
* **Antivirus.** `promissory::take` no longer puts it faceup on receipt (its `playArea` flag would have
  done so); the holder may place it at `SPACE_COMBAT_STARTED` / `GROUND_COMBAT_STARTED` (any combat,
  per the printed text). It returns through `promissory::spend_support_on_activation`, which every
  activation path already calls (Blood Pact / Dark Pact list, `"antivirus"` added).

## Technology-rights sweep

`technology::has_technology_text` now backs the effect gate of these faction technologies (the local
`has_technology` / `owns_technology` / `technology_ready` helper of each file, or the inline check):
arborec `bio`; argent `ah`; empyrean `as`, `vw` (dropped redundant `is_empyrean`); ghost `ds`, `wg`;
keleres `iihq`, `asn` (dropped `is_keleres`); mahact `gr` (holder = any seat with the text ready, via
`vote.rs`); mentak `mc`, `so`; muaat `mr`; naalu `ng`; naaz `pfa`, `sc`; nomad `tcs`; saar `cm`
(also `technology.rs`); sardakk `vpw`; winnu `lgf`, `htp`; yin `yso`, `ic`; yssaril `tp`, `mi`; cabal
`vtx`; hacan `qdn`, jol-nar `scc`, `ers`, xxcha `nf` (`faction_techs.rs`).

Unit-upgrade faction technologies (`ac2`, `so2`, `lw2`, `swa2`, `pws2`, `sdn2`, `cl2`, `hcf2`, `m2`, `exo2`,
`se2`, `ht2`, `dt2`, `ffac2`): a unit upgrade's text is the stat block of a unit the Valefar card is not,
and the Nekro has no such units, so assimilating one does nothing. The rules-faithful choice taken:
**not offered** as an X/Y target (Rules question 2); gaining one is impossible anyway (another
faction's faction technology). An upgrade the Nekro owns through `apply_unit_upgrades` is unaffected.

### Not offered (checks in files outside my scope; coordinator)

`nekro::assimilation_options` currently offers X/Y on any non-upgrade faction technology of the source.
These gates still read `technologies.contains`, so a token on them would lend nothing:

| Tech | Gate | File |
|---|---|---|
| `l4` (Letnev) | `invasion.rs:4052` | not mine |
| `nes` | `combat.rs:2108` | not mine |
| `pm` | `faction_abilities.rs` (`biomes`, ~338/410) | not mine |
| `it` | `reactions.rs:1036/1085` | not mine |
| `executiveorder` | Keleres-only by design (the vote has the Nekro as speaker, who cannot vote) | keleres.rs |

Either swap those checks to `technology::has_technology_text` / `technology_text_ready` /
`exhaust_technology_text`, or add the ids to an exclusion list in `assimilation_options` (done below
under "Exclusion list").

## Hook / change requests (files not mine)

1. `seating.rs`: the Nekro's `startingTech` is only `dxa`, Nekro cannot research and nobody owns
   `vax`/`vay` to be gained, so **no route gives the Nekro the Valefar cards**. Either deploy with `vax`
   and `vay` or document another route (Rules question 1). Tests grant them directly.
2. `invasion.rs:4052` (`l4`), `combat.rs:2108` (`nes`), `faction_abilities.rs` (`pm`),
   `reactions.rs` (`it`): the sweep above.
3. `tests/decision_delivery_inventory.rs`: register the sites below.
4. `nekro_units.rs` TECHNOLOGIES: `vax`, `vay` (part A reports them complete subject to request 1).
5. Part B: a Nekro commander unlock should call `factions::nekro::assimilators_with_tokens`.

## Decision sites to register

* `nekro.rs`: `take_from` (1 Choice: "gain a technology, or assimilate instead"; decision source
  `FactionAbility("technological_singularity" | "galactic_threat")`, subtype `assimilate`).
* `action_cards::predicted_outcome` (existing, now also used by Galactic Threat).
* Propagation pool choice: existing `strategy_cards::gain_tokens` site.

## Rules questions

1. How does the Nekro get Valefar Assimilator X and Y? Starting technology is Dacxive Animators only,
   the Nekro cannot research, and a gain needs another owner.
2. Unit-upgrade faction technologies: no text to lend; excluded as targets (an alternative would be to
   offer them and lend nothing, which only wastes a token).
3. Propagation after a priced research: the Technology secondary charges 4/6 resources before the
   research; "gain 3 command tokens instead" replaces the research, not the price. The player can
   decline the optional research, so no one is forced to overpay.
4. A token whose technology is no longer owned by anyone else lends nothing; the card may then take
   a new token.
5. Antivirus is offered at the start of any combat, to any holder, as printed (no participation test).
6. Galactic Threat after a Deadly Plot discard pays nothing (same reading as Construction Rider's
   payout).

## Commands (all `-j1`, `CARGO_PROFILE_TEST_DEBUG=0 ..._INCREMENTAL=false ..._CODEGEN_UNITS=16`)

* `cargo test -p ti4-engine --lib -j1 factions::nekro::` : 10 nekro.rs tests pass (plus part B's
  `nekro_units` tests, part B's two failures while it was mid-edit are theirs).
* `cargo test -p ti4-engine -j1 --no-fail-fast -- --test-threads=12`: lib 2508 passed, 1 failed, 1 ignored;
  `content_ids_resolve` 1/1; `decision_delivery_inventory` 3 passed, 1 failed; doctests 5/5.
  * `faction_abilities::tests::the_gap_is_reported_rather_than_implied` fails: `unimplemented(POK)` is now
    empty (Nekro's three abilities were the last unclaimed ones). Not my file; the assertion
    `!missing.is_empty()` should become "every unanswered ability is genuinely unclaimed" or be dropped.
  * `decision_delivery_inventory::every_producer_and_delivery_site_matches_the_reviewed_registry`: unreviewed
    `nekro.rs take_from` (Choice 1, AskObserved 1) = mine, expected; `nekro_units.rs ask` (part B) and
    `production.rs produce_unit_by_ability` (AskObserved 1, not from this package).
* A first run exposed a trap: a `#[cfg(test)] use ...` line near the top of a source file makes the
  decision-registry scanner treat the rest of the file as test code (it hid arborec, ghost, mentak, naalu,
  naaz, winnu and yssaril sites). Removed; the test imports live inside each `mod tests`.
* `cargo clippy -p ti4-engine --all-targets -j1`: nothing in `nekro.rs`, `faction_techs.rs` or my hunks
  (the `promissory.rs:385` and `vote.rs` too-many-lines warnings predate this change).
* rustfmt (edition 2024) applied only to files that were rustfmt-clean before: nekro, technology,
  promissory, arborec, ghost, mentak, naalu, naaz, winnu, yssaril. `game.rs` untouched by rustfmt.

## Exclusion list

`nekro::TEXT_NOT_LENDABLE` = `l4`, `nes`, `pm`, `it`, `executiveorder`: never offered an X/Y token (see
"Not offered"). Remove an id when its gate is swept.

## Ledger

`print_faction_ledger` was not rerun after the final edits (nekro's technologies/units/leaders are part B's
claims and the coordinator adds `vax`, `vay`).

## Integration

Coordinator-integration pass (single agent).

* `nekro.rs` MODULE.hooks now sets `commander_unlocked`, `leader_action`, `use_leader`, `component_actions`, `perform_component` from `nekro_units` (part A set none, nothing to chain). Real-route tests in `nekro_units`: `nekro_agent_is_offered_and_resolves_through_the_leader_route`, `nekro_hero_is_offered_and_resolves_through_the_leader_route` (both via `leaders::component_actions` / `leaders::use_leader`), `nekro_commander_unlocks_through_check_unlocks`, `nekro_error_error_is_offered_and_resolves_through_the_component_route` (`faction_abilities::component_actions` / `perform_component`).
* Valefar X/Y: coordinator ruling, the Nekro begins with both cards. `seating::deploy` inserts `vax`, `vay` for `nekro` only (test `the_nekro_begins_with_both_valefar_assimilators`); `nekro_units::TECHNOLOGIES` = `vax`, `vay`, `nekroc4y`, `nekroc4r`. Hook request 1 and 4 above are done.
* Gates swept to `technology::has_technology_text` / `technology_text_ready` / `exhaust_technology_text`: `l4` (`invasion::space_cannon_defense`), `nes` (`combat::non_euclidean_shielding`), `pm` (`faction_abilities` production biomes), `it` (`reactions` instinct training). `TEXT_NOT_LENDABLE` is now only `executiveorder` (the Nekro cannot vote, so its text is unusable by design). Tests: `invasion::an_assimilated_l4_disruptors_silence_space_cannon_defense_for_the_nekro`, `nekro::an_assimilated_nes_and_the_lifted_exclusions_work_for_the_nekro`.
* `faction_abilities::the_gap_is_reported_rather_than_implied` now checks, per catalogue ability, that it is reported exactly when neither registered nor blocked (may be empty).
* `decision_delivery_inventory.rs`: producers `nekro.rs take_from`, `nekro_units.rs ask` (ObservedHere, via `ask_seeing`); observed asks for those and `production.rs produce_unit_by_ability`.
* **`nekrobt` stays unclaimed**: its flagship lending needs every faction's flagship hooks to accept the Nekro flagship; `LENDABLE_FLAGSHIPS` is empty and the Z option is never offered.

Results: `cargo test -p ti4-engine -j1 --no-fail-fast -- --test-threads=12`: lib 2516 passed, 1 ignored; content_ids_resolve 1; decision_delivery_inventory 4; doctests 5; all green. `cargo test -p ti4-policy -p ti4-sim`: 273 + 51 passed, 0 failed. Ledger: `nekro 13/14 implemented`, missing only `nekrobt`. Soak `base_faction_soak -- nekro 0 25 10`: 25 games, 0 failures.


## Valefar Assimilator Z (`nekrobt`) - 2026-10-07

Operator rulings: 7 Z tokens; the Nekro flagship has every flagship's text, off by default; a placed Z token switches that faction's flagship text on, permanently; at most one Z per faction (Keleres variants share one flagship, so one token covers all three); text only, never stats (combat value/dice, move, capacity, sustain damage, printed bombard/space cannon). Also: `nekroc4y` / `nekroc4r` belong to an obscure variant, not the game.

* Storage: `faction_marks["nekro:token:<player>:Z"]` = comma list of faction aliases (max 7). `nekro::place_z`, `z_assimilated_factions`, `z_lends`. Offer `z|<source>|<faction>` alongside gain/X/Y at Technological Singularity and Galactic Threat while tokens remain and the flagship is not already lent.
* Predicate: `factions::flagship_has_text(state, owner, unit_type, flagship_id)` (unit is that flagship, or a `nekro_flagship` of a Nekro holding Z on that faction) and `factions::has_flagship_text_in(state, owner, system, id)`. "This unit" = the Nekro flagship; "your" = the Nekro's.
* Timing abilities for Arborec and Cabal flagships were only armed for those factions' seats; they are now also armed for Nekro seats (conditions decide).

### Per-flagship result (24 flagships; 22 lent and tested, 1 inert, 1 no text)

| flagship | result |
|---|---|
| arborec, argent, cabal, empyrean, ghost, hacan, jolnar, keleres, l1z1x, letnev (repair and shield strip), mahact, mentak, muaat, naalu, naaz, nomad, sardakk, sol, titans, winnu, yin, yssaril | lent, one real-route test each (`a_nekro_flagship_with_the_<faction>_z_token_...`) |
| xxcha | lent-but-inert: its text uses the unit's SPACE CANNON, the Nekro flagship has none (stats not lent). Z still offered. |
| saar | not lendable: the flagship has no text (stats only: anti-fighter barrage). Z not offered. |

Notes: Titans DEPLOY places the Nekro flagship in place of a PDS. Naaz gives the Nekro's mechs the die. Winnu: the Nekro flagship rolls dice equal to the opponent's non-fighter ships, replacing its printed dice; its hit value stays its own printed 9. Mahact bonus applies (the Nekro never holds other players' command tokens in its fleet pool). Sardakk excludes the Nekro flagship itself ("other ships"). Keleres and Argent no longer need the owner to be that faction. Genesis places the Nekro's infantry.

Coverage: per-flagship lending is the predicate sweep plus one test each (no combinations of Z abilities tested). Also tests: toggle off by default / on / not for non-Nekro or other units / not without breakthrough; 7-token cap; no double Z (Keleres families); offer and placement through the Singularity route.

### Ledger rule
`factions::assets` technologies now = faction-sheet `factionTech` (which holds the unit upgrades) plus Thunder's Edge-source reprints. Compared every faction's technology set before/after by script over the content: only Nekro changes (`nekroc4y`, `nekroc4r` removed; code kept, unclaimed). Keleres `executiveorder` (TE) stays. Nekro ledger: 12/12 (was 13/14 with `nekrobt` missing); all 27 rows full.

### Results
`cargo test -p ti4-engine -j1 --no-fail-fast -- --test-threads=12`: lib 2541 passed, 1 ignored; content_ids_resolve 1; decision_delivery_inventory 4; doctests 5. `-p ti4-policy -p ti4-sim`: 273 + 51 passed. Soak `base_faction_soak -- nekro 0 25 10`: 25 games, 0 failures. No new ask sites (the Z option reuses `take_from`).
