Neutrality: `a_game_without_winnu_is_offered_nothing`. Every window checks the seat's faction or card.

## Hook requests

1. `game.rs begin_one_move`: pass `Some(index)` through `effective_move_value_for_ship` (already requested in BF-00e). `winnubt`'s +1 stays in a private `faction_marks` row `private:<p>:winnu:imperator` = `origin|index|ships_in_origin`. It is void once the ship count at the origin changes (a move out shifts indices), so if the player moves another ship first the bonus is lost. A "ship moved" payload with system and index, or a consume hook, would fix this.
2. `htp` and `acq`: `planet_spend_value` has no `sources`; the module reads DEFAULT. Pass `sources` if non-default scopes matter.
3. `component_actions` has no `sources`; `lgf` ACTION uses DEFAULT for the box check (placement itself uses the real sources).

## Rules questions

* Reclamation / Reclaimer: "tactical action during which you gained control" is approximated as `PLANET_CONTROL_GAINED` for the active seat, kept until the next `TURN_BEGAN`. Control gained without that event (action cards) is not seen.
* `htp`: only uses of PRODUCTION that emit `PRODUCTION_USED` (tactical action). Warfare secondary via `resolve_timed` does not emit it (BF-00d request 2). `htp_planets` offers only planets whose resources differ from influence.
* `lgf` link: Mecatol links to every alpha/beta system while the Winnu player has an active system and does not control Mecatol.
* Hero: cards offered are those held by any seat, except `te6warfare` (it returns a free tactical action that cannot run inside a leader effect). Followers are asked one by one (yes/no), in clockwise order, then each pays the usual token cost through the foreign window. An illegal answer inside the primary aborts after partial resolution (no rollback available).
* Commander unlock by combat: SPACE/GROUND_COMBAT_STARTED payload `system` equals 18 and the seat is attacker or defender.
* Imperator: opponent = first other owner of ships (space) or ground forces on the planet; counts `support_holders` entries held by that opponent.

## Decision sites to register

`winnu.rs`: `reclaimer` (1, `ask_seeing`), `htp` (1), `imperator` (1), `use_leader` (2: card, follower yes/no; plus the follower choice `pending` is asked through `ask_seeing` in the same loop = 3 asks). Reclamation, agent and the commander unlock ask only the ability window's own question.

## Commands and results

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `cargo test -p ti4-engine --lib -- factions::winnu` | 23 passed, 0 failed |
| `cargo test -p ti4-engine --lib -- factions::` | 104 passed, 1 failed: `hooks_movement::tests::empty_tables_are_neutral` (asserts no module registers a movement hook; Winnu now registers `linked_systems`, `move_bonus`. That assertion needs updating by the coordinator) |
| `cargo clippy -p ti4-engine --all-targets` | no warnings in winnu.rs |
| `rustfmt --edition 2024 winnu.rs` | clean |
| `cargo test -p ti4-engine -q --no-fail-fast` | lib 1611 passed, 3 failed: the `hooks_movement` one above, `production::tests::the_mc_technology_doubles_trade_good_payment_value` (not mine), `strategy::bf00d_tests::a_waiver_lets_a_tokenless_follower...` (coordinator's in-flight waiver change); `decision_delivery_inventory` 3 passed, 1 failed (the sites above) |

Ledger: `winnu 11/11 implemented`.

## Review fixes

| Finding | Fix | Test |
|---|---|---|
| B2 | `hero_cards` now includes `unclaimed_strategy_cards`. `te6warfare` stays excluded (its primary is a free tactical action that cannot run inside a leader effect), so `winnuhero` is no longer claimed in `MODULE` (ledger 10/11). | `the_hero_offers_unclaimed_cards_too` |
| S1 | Primary resolves first on a state snapshot; anything but `Ability::Resolved` (Err, `Unresolved`, `FreeTactical`) restores the snapshot and returns `Some(false)`. Followers are asked after the primary. Each follower's token plus secondary restore together on error. No new decision sites (same asks, reordered). | `a_failed_primary_leaves_the_game_untouched`, `the_hero_resolves_a_primary_and_lets_chosen_players_follow` (uses real card ids `pok1leadership`) |
| S2 | `room_for` (max 1 space dock, 2 PDS per planet) gates Reclamation and Reclaimer, re-checked at effect time. | `a_structure_is_not_placed_where_the_planet_has_no_room` |
| S5 | New `tactical_mark` on `SYSTEM_ACTIVATED`; control gained is recorded only after it; cleared on `TURN_BEGAN`. | `control_gained_in_a_strategic_action_does_not_count` |
| S6 | Imperator mark is `origin|type|damaged|count`; `move_bonus` goes to the first matching ship; `SHIP_MOVED` ability consumes it when a matching ship leaves. Hook request 1 above is superseded. | `the_imperator_bonus_survives_another_ship_leaving_and_is_spent_by_its_own` |

Checks: `factions::winnu` 28 passed, 0 failed; no clippy warnings in winnu.rs; rustfmt clean.

## Final pass (2026-10-03): `winnuhero` stays unclaimed

The only ledger gap is `winnuhero` (10/11). Its printed text is "Perform the primary ability of any strategy card". Every card but Thunder's Edge Warfare (`te6warfare`) is performed in `use_leader`. Warfare's primary returns `Ability::FreeTactical(system)`: a tactical action without a token, for which `game.rs` (the strategic-action path, ~line 1878) builds a `TacticalWindow`, sets `pending = "move"`, bumps `activation_seq`, sets `secondary_after_tactical`, and emits `SYSTEM_ACTIVATED`. A leader effect gets only a `TimingContext` and cannot do that. `perform_leader_action` (game.rs ~2381) discards the outcome, and `action_cards::perform_strategy_card` (Overrule) only records `active_system`, which no driver then consumes. Claiming the hero with Warfare excluded would be a partial implementation, so it is not claimed.

Hook request (shared files, not made): let `use_leader` report a pending free tactical activation (for example `crate::leaders` returns it, or `winnuhero` stores it in `state.faction_marks["private:<p>:winnu:free_tactical"] = "<system>"`), and in `Game::perform_leader_action` after a successful `use_leader` run the same block as the `Ability::FreeTactical` arm of the strategic-action path in `game.rs` (factor it into a method taking `(active, system, window)`). The followers' Warfare secondary would then run from `StrategySecondaryWindow::foreign` as for other cards. Then `hero_cards` drops the `te6warfare` filter and the hero is added to `MODULE.leaders`.

Commands: `cargo test -p ti4-engine --lib -- factions::winnu` 28 passed, 0 failed; `cargo test -p ti4-engine --lib -- factions::` 341 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored; ledger `winnu 10/11 implemented` (`Leader winnuhero`). No code changed this pass.

## Winnu hero continuation consumer (2026-10-04; Game integration in progress)

The hero is now claimed by the Winnu module and `hero_cards` includes all held and unclaimed strategy cards, including Thunder's Edge Warfare (`te6warfare`). Two new faction hook consumers split the effect at the required continuation boundary: `use_leader_strategy_primary` chooses a card, resolves its primary, and returns `(card, Ability)` to the Game driver; `leader_strategy_followers` asks the other seats in clockwise order after the primary continuation completes. Both questions carry the existing `FactionAbility("winnuhero")` decision contexts (`hero_card`, `hero_follower`) and propagate invalid choices as `TimingError::IllegalChoice`.

Focused consumer tests added: `hero_primary_offers_warfare_and_returns_the_free_tactical_result`, `hero_chooses_followers_clockwise_after_primary_resolution`, and `hero_invalid_primary_or_follower_answer_is_propagated`. They have not yet been run. Root owns the Game continuation, tactical activation, secondary window, and delayed hero purge integration; no end-to-end or completion claim is made here. Run the shared low-memory build and the Game integration fixture before changing the ledger status to complete. Decision inventory remains the existing `winnuhero` sites `hero_card` and `hero_follower`.
