# BF-sardakk: Sardakk N'orr (`factions/sardakk.rs`)

Implementer: Sonnet subagent. Card text: `crates/ti4-content/content/*.json`, DEFAULT sources. Tests are the
inline `mod tests` in `sardakk.rs` (22).

Regression: `a_game_without_the_card_is_never_asked_anything_by_this_module` (no Sardakk seat: no Sardakk
ability is ever offered). Every bookkeeping ability has a condition that is false unless a Sardakk seat
holds the card/mark (`is_norr_seat`, `agent_ready`).

## Hook requests

1. **`hooks_ground::GroundHooks::commit_candidates`** (`hooks_ground.rs`, `invasion.rs::commit_pool`): add
   `galaxy: Option<&Galaxy>` to the signature. The commander needs adjacency ("each planet in adjacent
   systems that do not contain 1 of your command tokens"; command tokens are `SystemState::command_tokens`),
   and `GameState` carries no map. Until then only the active system's planets are offered.
2. **Sardakk hero** (`game.rs`): an `Aftermath` entry that opens `InvasionWindow::at_commit_step` after the
   ships are moved ("After you move ships into the active system"), offered when an unlocked hero's
   `leader_action` says so; after `GROUND_COMMITMENT_FINISHED` the faction purges the card and returns the
   player's ships in the active system to reinforcements. Already recorded in `BF-00c-ground.md` item 9.
3. (nice to have) `ACTION_COMPLETED` payload `kind` ("tactical"/"strategic"/"component") and `system`, in
   `game.rs::emit_action_completed`. The agent works around it with activation marks (below).

## Decision sites to register (`tests/decision_delivery_inventory.rs`)

From the inventory test's observed set (all in `sardakk.rs`):

| function | `Choice` | `AskObserved` |
|---|---|---|
| `exotrireme` | 2 | 2 |
| `supremacy` | 1 | 1 |

(`place_units_choosing`, `gain_tokens` are existing registered sites.) The "may" of each optional ability
is the resolver's own use/decline question; this module asks nothing twice.

## Rules questions / known limits

- **Agent window.** `ACTION_COMPLETED` fires after `active_system` is cleared and does not say tactical or
  strategic, so the activating system is remembered in `GameState::faction_marks`
  (`sardakk:agent:tactical:<player>`) while a Sardakk seat holds T'ro readied, cleared by `TURN_BEGAN`,
  `STRATEGIC_ACTION_BEGAN` and the use itself. Edge: an *additional* action (Master Plan, Minister of War)
  that is a component action after a tactical action in the same turn could read the leftover mark. A
  tactical action started by a strategy card's free tactical action is not covered.
- **Exotrireme II** is offered only when another ship is in the system (a use that destroys only itself
  is not offered). "Up to 2" otherwise allows 1; it destroys any player's ships including the owner's.
- **Mech** (see `BF-00c-ground.md`): the hit is produced after the round's simultaneous removals. The
  produced hit carries cause `ground_combat`, so an opposing N'orr mech that sustains it answers in turn
  (bounded: each mech sustains once).
- **Tekklar Legion**: "invasion combat" read as the ground combat on a planet (`GROUND_COMBAT_STARTED`).
  The bonus is a mark cleared by `GROUND_COMBAT_ENDED` for that planet or the next `TURN_BEGAN`.
- **N'orr Supremacy**: research follows normal prerequisites (`technology::researchable` filtered to unit
  upgrades); "win a combat" = the `winner` of `SPACE_COMBAT_ENDED` / `GROUND_COMBAT_ENDED`.
- The commander unlock counts planets (not systems) in systems that hold no faction's home planet.

## Update 2026-10-03 (commander adjacency, hero)

* `sardakkcommander`: done and claimed. `commit_candidates` now uses the map: adjacent systems without the
  invader's command token (supernovas excluded; other anomaly movement restrictions are not modelled).
  Test: `the_commander_reaches_adjacent_systems_without_the_invaders_tokens`.
* `sardakkhero`: done and claimed. `skip_to_commit` asks Sh'val's question (unlocked hero, owner has ships in
  the active system; the engine cannot say which ships *moved in*), `GROUND_COMMITMENT_FINISHED` purges the
  hero and returns the owner's ships in the system. Real-Game tests (seated_game + Game::with_table +
  galaxy, movement -> skip -> commit): `the_hero_skips_to_the_commitment_then_is_purged_and_returns_the_ships`,
  `the_hero_may_be_declined_and_is_not_offered_while_locked`. Ground forces left in the space area are not
  touched.
* New decision site: `skip_to_commit` (1 Choice, 1 AskObserved).
* Ledger: `sardakk 12/12 implemented`. `cargo test -p ti4-engine --lib -- factions::sardakk`: 25 passed;
  clippy: 0 warnings in `sardakk.rs`; rustfmt applied.

## Update 2026-10-03 (hero review fixes)

`skip_to_commit` now requires `ships_moved_this_activation > 0`, a planet in the system, and ground forces
in the space area or commander candidates. Tests: positive path moves a cruiser in through a real `Game`;
`the_hero_is_not_offered_without_a_moved_ship_or_anything_to_land`. `factions::sardakk`: 26 passed; clippy 0
warnings in `sardakk.rs`; rustfmt applied. Ledger `sardakk 12/12 implemented`.
