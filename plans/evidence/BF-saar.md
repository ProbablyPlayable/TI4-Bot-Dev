Branch `wp/base-factions`, uncommitted. Code: `crates/ti4-engine/src/factions/saar.rs`. Card text: `crates/ti4-content/content/*.json` at DEFAULT.

## Items

| Kind | Id | Status | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| ability | `scavenge` | done (timing `PLANET_CONTROL_GAINED` after; fires from the invasion emit site only, see Hook requests 4) | `scavenge_pays_a_trade_good_for_each_planet_gained_and_only_to_the_gainer` |
| unit | `saar_mech` Scavenger Zeta DEPLOY | done (same event; optional, 1 TG, mech placed on that planet, box-checked) | `scavenger_zeta_costs_a_trade_good_and_places_a_mech_or_is_declined` |
| unit | `saar_flagship` | done: statistics only (corpus has no ability text); AFB comes from data | `the_stats_of_the_flagship_are_data_driven` (checks only ship/flagship; AFB 6x4 is in `units.json`, not asserted by a combat test) |
| promissory | `ragh` | done (holder, `UNITS_COMMITTED` after; Saar player picks the destination planet; note returned) | `ragh_s_call_moves_the_saar_forces_to_a_planet_they_control_and_returns_the_note`, `ragh_s_call_is_not_offered_without_the_note_or_without_saar_forces_there` |

| leader | `saarcommander` | partial: unlock (3 space docks) done and tested; effect NOT implemented, so not claimed | `the_commander_unlocks_at_three_space_docks` |
| technology | `cm` Chaos Mapping | partial: start-of-turn production implemented (offer gate tested, decline tested; a full production run is not tested); activation bar NOT implemented; not claimed | `chaos_mapping_production_needs_the_technology_the_action_phase_and_a_producer` |
| ability | `nomadic` | blocked (hook request 1) | |
| technology/unit | `ffac2`, `saar_spacedock`, `saar_spacedock2` | blocked: production and capacity already work in the space area (BF-00d), but moving/retreating as a ship and blockade destruction are not wired in `tactical.rs`/combat; not claimed | |
| leader | `saaragent` | blocked (hook request 3) | |
| breakthrough | `saarbt` | not started (see request 5) | |
| regression | no Saar seat | `a_game_without_saar_is_offered_no_saar_ability` (empty script fails on any choice; board and TG unchanged) | |

## Hook requests

1. `objectives.rs::controls_home_system` (61.16, the gate in `scoreable_on`): Nomadic needs it to be true for a player with `nomadic`. Request: `Hooks::ignores_home_control(state, content, player) -> bool` (any module), or have the function return true when `faction_abilities::has(.., "nomadic")`.
2. `tactical.rs::activatable`: Chaos Mapping "Other players cannot activate asteroid fields that contain 1 or more of your ships". Needs a hook `cannot_activate(state, content, activator, system) -> bool` (any) consulted per system; the activation choice is generated from this list, so no late rejection.
3. Captain's Genome (`saaragent`): "When a player activates a system: exhaust to increase the move value of 1 of that player's ships to match the highest move value of a ship on the board." Needs `movement::move_bonus` (exists) plus `game.rs::begin_one_move` using `effective_move_value_for_ship` with the ship index (BF-00e Request 1, still unwired), so a chosen ship's bonus is honoured; the module would store the chosen index in `faction_marks`.
4. `PLANET_CONTROL_GAINED` is emitted only from `invasion.rs` (landing). Other gains of control (Reparations/Infiltrate-style effects, relic or action-card captures, `legendary`, `thunders_edge` placement, Integrated Economy paths) call `faction_abilities::control_gained` or nothing and emit no window, so Scavenge and the DEPLOY do not fire there. Request: emit the typed event at every control change, or pass the existing `Hooks::control_gained` through all of them (that hook is state-only and cannot ask a choice, so the typed event is preferable).
5. Mobile dock (BF-00d Request 3): `tactical.rs:285` use `UnitType::moves_as_ship()`, retreat, and `production::destroy_blockaded_mobile_docks` after movement and combat. Deorbit Barrage (`saarbt`) and the commander's effect are otherwise implementable once their routes exist: the commander ("When you produce fighters or infantry: place each at any of your non-blockaded space docks") needs a placement hook in `production.rs` (override the placement spot per unit); the breakthrough ACTION needs `breakthrough` component-action plumbing for the module (the shared `breakthroughs` registry) and a 2-system distance helper from asteroid-field systems.
6. Destruction of infantry by the hero is a direct removal (no destruction event exists for ground forces); fighters go through `combat::destroy_units` which stages `SHIP_DESTROYED` in `pending_destructions` but nothing announces them from a leader hook (leader hooks get no `Resolving`).

## Rules questions

* Ragh's Call: who chooses the destination planet? Implemented as the Saar player. Is the planet being invaded a legal destination? Excluded (the forces leave it).
* Hero: "adjacent" uses `Galaxy::adjacent` (hex neighbours plus wormholes), not player-specific links.
* Scavenger Zeta: "place 1 mech on that planet" ignores nothing; refused when the mech box is empty (31.4).

## Decision sites to register

| Function | Choices |
|---|---|
| `saar::ragh_call` (via `ask`) | 1 |
| `saar::chaos_mapping_production` (via `ask`) | 1 (system pick, only when several) |
| `saar::hero` (via `ask`) | 1 |

(The helper `ask` builds the `Choice`; the coordinator should register it as one producer, as with `yin.rs::ask_one`.) `produce` runs the ordinary production window (`production::produce_by_ability`), which is registered already.

## Commands run

| Command | Result |

| `cargo clippy -p ti4-engine --all-targets` | no warning in `saar.rs` (type_complexity allowed with reason on `ragh_targets`) |

| `cargo test -p ti4-engine -q --no-fail-fast` | lib 1760 passed, 3 failed (naaz), 1 ignored; `decision_delivery_inventory` 1 failed (unregistered sites, including mine above); other binaries ok |

Ledger line: `saar       5/13 implemented` (missing: nomadic, cm, ffac2, saar_spacedock, saar_spacedock2, saaragent, saarcommander, saarbt).

## Review fixes (Opus review)

| Finding | Fix |
|---|---|
| B2 | Hero now also destroys other players' infantry in the space area (`units_of_base` yields space infantry; removed with `remove`). Test pushes space infantry. |
| B3 | Hero removes fighters directly like infantry, everything decided before the first removal; nothing is staged in `pending_destructions` (asserted). Hook request: leader effects cannot announce destructions (no `Resolving` in `use_leader`). |
| S1 | `production_systems` requires non-empty `production::producers`. Chaos Mapping's production is registered under `cfg!(test)` only until `cm` can be claimed whole (activation bar waits on `MovementHooks::cannot_activate`, not implemented). |
| S4 | `scavenge` and `saar_mech` unclaimed (partial): they fire only from the invasion landing path; the hook request (typed event at every control change) is Hook request 4 above. Abilities stay registered. |
| N6 | Hero adjacency uses `movement::PlayerAdjacency`. |
| N7 | Scavenge gated on `faction_abilities::has(.., "scavenge")`. |

Decision sites: unchanged (`ask` callers `ragh_call`, `chaos_mapping_production` (test-only registration), `hero`; none renamed).

Checks: `factions::saar` 9 passed; clippy no warning in `saar.rs`; rustfmt run. Ledger: `saar 3/13 implemented` (claimed: saar_flagship, ragh, saarhero).

## Update after routes F1/F3/F4 (Codex's Nomadic and Chaos Mapping verified)

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| `nomadic` (Codex: `StrategyHooks::scores_without_home`) | claimed; test `nomadic_scores_without_the_home_planets_and_others_still_need_them` (Saar passes `controls_home_system` with no home planets, Sol does not) |
| `cm` (Codex: `cannot_activate` plus the start-of-turn production, now registered live) | claimed; tests `chaos_mapping_bars_other_players_from_an_asteroid_field_holding_a_cm_ship`, `chaos_mapping_production_needs_the_technology_the_action_phase_and_a_producer`. The production run itself (full window) is not driven by a test |
| `scavenge`, `saar_mech` DEPLOY | claimed again: control gains now emit `PLANET_CONTROL_GAINED` from invasion, Maxis and Thunder's Edge placement (BF-F1); tests unchanged (emit-level) |
| `ffac2`, `saar_spacedock`, `saar_spacedock2` | claimed: `movable_into` offers the dock as a mover (BF-F4), blockade destruction runs after movement and space combat (`game.rs`, `combat.rs`), retreat includes `moves_as_ship` (`combat.rs:2636`); test `floating_factories_move_as_ships_and_a_blockade_destroys_them` covers the offer and the destruction function, not the game.rs/combat.rs call sites or a retreat |
| `saaragent` Captain Mendosa | claimed: `SYSTEM_ACTIVATED` window, agent owner picks a slower ship of the activator, exhausts; `MovementHooks::move_bonus` returns the gap to the fastest printed ship move, keyed on `activation_seq`, origin and ship index; test `the_agent_raises_one_ship_to_the_fastest_move_on_the_board` (bonus read through the hook, not through a full tactical action) |
| `saarcommander` | still partial (unlock only): effect "place produced fighters/infantry at any non-blockaded dock" needs a production placement-spot override; no hook exists (F3 added only extra production and cost reduction). Hook request |
| `saarbt` Deorbit Barrage | not implemented (ACTION with variable resource spend, dice, hits on a ground force up to 2 systems from an asteroid field with own ships); needs a payment API for "spend any amount of resources" and a hit-assignment helper for a chosen planet; not attempted |

Agent rules question: "highest move value" is the printed value among ships on the board (all players), not boosted values. New decision sites: `saar::agent` (1, via `ask`; subtype `agent_ship`). Existing: `ragh_call`, `chaos_mapping_production`, `hero`.

Commands: `cargo test -p ti4-engine --lib -- factions::saar` 14 passed, 0 failed; clippy no warning in `saar.rs`; rustfmt run. Ledger: `saar 11/13 implemented` (missing saarcommander, saarbt).

## Update: commander and breakthrough investigation (2026-10-03)

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| `saarcommander` Rowl Sarring effect | NOT claimed. No existing production hook can override where a produced unit is placed: `production::placements` returns spots inside the producing system only, and `ProductionWindow::place` writes into `self.system`. `EconomyHooks` has only `extra_production`, `extra_production_planet`, `cannot_produce`, `production_cost_reduction`. Faction-side logic is ready: `saar::commander_docks(state, content, sources, galaxy, player) -> Vec<(SystemId, Option<PlanetId>)>` (docks of an unlocked commander that are not in or adjacent to a system with another player's units; adjacency via `PlayerAdjacency`), test `the_commander_docks_exclude_systems_in_or_next_to_other_players_units`. It is `#[allow(dead_code)]` until the hook below exists. |
| `saarbt` Deorbit Barrage | NOT claimed, not implemented. Missing seams: (a) `Hooks::perform_component` gets no `Resolver`, so `invasion::assign_ground_hits_in_timing` (needs one) cannot announce the sustain/destroy events; (b) no exhausted-breakthrough state (the engine tracks none; would need a `faction_marks` flag plus a ready step in the status phase); (c) "spend any amount of resources" has no quantity prompt (`production::pay_seeing` takes a fixed cost); (d) "up to 2 systems away" is undefined for wormholes (`Galaxy::distance` is hex-only); (e) the victim chooses nothing but the hit goes to a planet's ground forces owned by possibly several players. |

### Hook request 7 (commander placement), exact change

* File `crates/ti4-engine/src/factions/hooks_economy.rs`, new field in `EconomyHooks` (and `NONE`):
  `pub produced_destinations: Option<fn(&GameState, &ContentStore, SourceSet, Option<&Galaxy>, &PlayerId, &SystemId /*producing system*/, &str /*unit base type*/) -> Vec<(SystemId, Option<PlanetId>)>>`
  plus dispatch `pub fn produced_destinations(...)` concatenating modules (deduped, sorted).
* Call sites in `production.rs`: `ProductionWindow::placement_choice` appends one option per extra destination, id `"<system>|<planet or space>"` (distinct from local spots, which are bare planet ids or `SPACE`), only for unit base types the hook returns destinations for (fighter, infantry), labelled as a placement elsewhere; `ProductionWindow::place` (line ~2356) resolves such an id and pushes the unit into that system's `units` / `planet_units` instead of `self.system`; `placements()` is used for the can-produce gate, so a producing system with no local spot but a remote dock is still buildable (add the remote destinations to the non-empty check at line ~1108 and ~1968).
* Saar's side then returns `commander_docks(..)` filtered: fighters to entries with any planet or `None` (space area of that system), infantry only to entries with `Some(planet)`; excludes the producing system's own spot (already offered locally). Capacity (fleet pool, fighter capacity at the destination) must still be checked by the shared code via `fleet`/`supply::allowed` at the destination.
* Rules question: neutral units (Gravity Rift/frontier-style non-player tokens) are not "another player's units"; implemented as units whose owner is a seated other player only (neutral owner ids are not seated players, but `unit.owner != player` is what is tested, so neutral-owned units currently DO count; confirm).

## Rowl Sarrig claimed (2026-10-03, coordinator)

Correction: the content text (`leaders.json` `saarcommander`) is "When you produce fighters or infantry: You may place each of those units at any of your space docks that are not blockaded." The earlier "not in or adjacent to another player's units" reading was wrong; the adjacency filter is gone.

Shared seam: `EconomyHooks::production_destinations` (hooks_economy.rs) returns places in other systems; `ProductionWindow::spots` appends them as `"<system>@<planet|space>"` (`production::REMOTE_SEPARATOR`, `placement_target`) only when the unit has a legal spot in the producing system (68.10 still bars ships from a blockaded system). `place` and `standing_after` resolve the target system; the placement preview measures a remote spot against that system's own standing. The "may" is the placement choice (the producing system's own spots stay offered).

Saar: blockaded = another player's ship (neutral counts) and no Saar ship in the dock's system. Fighters → space area; infantry → the dock's planet, or the space area for a Floating Factory.

Tests: `the_commander_docks_are_every_unblockaded_dock` (saar.rs); `a_module_destination_in_another_system_is_offered_and_placed_there`, `a_module_destination_is_not_offered_for_a_unit_the_system_cannot_place` (production.rs). `cargo test -p ti4-engine`: lib 1916 passed, 1 ignored; integration ok. Clippy: no warnings in touched code. Ledger: `saar 12/13` (gap `saarbt`).

## Deorbit Barrage implementation attempt (2026-10-04)

`crates/ti4-engine/src/factions/saar.rs` now registers `saarbt`, offers its faction component
action when the breakthrough is held and ready, validates target planets from Saar ships in
asteroid fields using up to two steps of `PlayerAdjacency`, prompts for an amount bounded by
`production::available`, pays before marking the card exhausted, and stages a typed
`SAAR_DEORBIT_BARRAGE` event. Its timing ability rolls the recorded number of dice against 4,
asks the Saar player to choose the specific ground force for each hit, then calls
`invasion::assign_selected_ground_hit_in_timing`; the unit owner chooses whether to sustain. A
`STATUS_PHASE_ENDED` ability clears the exhausted mark.

This is not yet claimed complete. The coordinator added `Hooks::mapped_component_actions` with
source-set and Galaxy context; Saar uses it to suppress the action unless a legal target is
available. Tests cover map gating, refusal atomicity, zero-resource use (per the printed "any
amount"), positive payment, status readiness, and staged-event flushing. A two-hit test puts a
cheaper infantry and mech owned by one rival alongside another player's mech, then chooses the
first owner's mech and the second owner's mech separately; each owner decides whether to sustain.
An invalid payment answer after a prior payment installment must leave the complete pre-action
state unchanged; implementation snapshots and restores around `pay_seeing`. Decision sites carry
`DecisionSource::FactionAbility("saarbt")` with subtypes `deorbit_spend`, `deorbit_target`, and
`deorbit_hit`; include all three in the decision-delivery inventory.

The coordinator's full-engine run reported the original single-mech test failing because the
expected sustain was absent despite a scripted 10+ roll and `sustain` answer. That test now includes
decision and resolver logs in its assertion diagnostic to identify any swallowed nested-choice
error. The additional fixtures and payment rollback have not been revalidated. Do not claim `saarbt`
until focused and full-engine tests pass.
