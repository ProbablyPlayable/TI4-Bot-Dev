# Card content — completion status (second implementer, Phase 7)

Status: **continuing the engine-completion plan** on `wp/engine-completion` (merged back to
`wp/r01-review-viewer-contract` too), updated 2026-08-30 after the handoff in
`plans/archive/HANDOFF_ENGINE_COMPLETION.md` expanded this work past the two owned files.

Mission per `plans/PI_BRIEF_CARD_CONTENT.md`: action-card effects (baseline 34/142) and agenda
effects (baseline 51/63) in the two owned files only:

- `crates/ti4-engine/src/action_cards.rs`
- `crates/ti4-engine/src/agenda_effects.rs`

## Coverage achieved

| area          | before | after  |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| action cards  | 34/142 | 135/142 |
| agendas       | 51/63  | 63/63  |

`cargo run --release -p ti4-engine --example coverage_report` (final run, after the
turn/status-flow batch): action cards 135 of 142 (95.1%), agendas 63 of 63, reaction windows 0
unsupported, plus the unchanged rows for exploration/relics/objectives/leaders/abilities.

## Commits (oldest first)

- `ecdb26c` — agendas to 63/63: the 12 missing availability arms, each named after the standing
  rule it relies on (e.g. availability "1 or more laws" vs. standing "the law must be in play");
  registry extended, tests added.
- `09061fc` — agenda rider family: `predicted_outcome` encoding in `state.agenda_predictions`
  (`"outcome|card_alias"`; bare outcome = legacy imperial +1 VP, which keeps the vote-order
  key-based logic in `vote.rs:251` green); `resolve_predictions` rewritten to dispatch per-card
  payoffs; `assassinate_representative` (sentinel `"none|assassin"` denies the vote without a
  payout), `insider_information` (honest no-op: a hidden peek has no state effect),
  `ancient_burial_sites`, `diplomatic_pressure`.
- `30ba998` — tactical-action reaction cards: `rally`, `forward_supply_base`, `counterstroke`,
  `decoy_operation`, `emergency_repairs`, `upgrade_ship`, `experimental_battlestation`,
  `reveal_prototype` (4 resources; named `baseUpgrade` matches the subject's `base_type()`,
  unnamed II-line matches the normalized unit name).
- `9a6fe0b` — all 25 remaining `window=Action` component-action cards: `harness_energy`,
  `economic_initiative`, `industrial_initiative`, `fighter_conscription`, `impersonation`,
  `plagiarize`, `archaeological_expedition`, `divert_funding`, `exploration_probe`,
  `refit_troops`, `scuttle`, `seize_artifact`, `exchange_program` (+`refuse_exchange`),
  `mercenary_contract`, `pirate_fleet`, `pirate_contract`, `brilliance`, `overrule`,
  `strategize`. The old "unmodelled" spend test was split into a spend test plus an
  `announce()` test for genuinely unimplemented cards.
- `cc40c70` — the seven cards the hooks from `873178e` (on `wp/engine-completion`) unblock:
  `distinguished`, `bribery` (via `vote::add_votes`, scoped by `agenda_seq` and read in
  `vote::record`), `sh1`–`sh4` (via `combat::grant_hit_cancellation`, two cancellable hits per
  copy, stacked across the round), `intercept` (via `combat::bar_retreat` on the declarant,
  inferred as the other ship-bearing combatant of the active system). Documented gaps: a bonus
  whose vote is already banked when `VOTES_CAST` fires counts for nothing (zero-planet voter /
  abstainer), and the unguarded `VOTES_CAST` row also offers `bribery` after a non-speaker's
  vote (a `Guard` sees the event and the holder but not the seating, so "the voter is the
  speaker" is inexpressible in `reactions.rs`).

After the handoff, the engine-completion line (hook `873178e` + handoff `3f2d27b`) was fast-
forwarded into this branch and continued here; `cc40c70` was merged back into
`wp/engine-completion` (clean fast-forward) so both branches agree.

- Combat-dice group (Direct Hit `dh1`–`dh4`, `rout`, `waylay`): the three card families above,
  closed in one package. `CombatWindow::settle` / `settle_open` / `roll_round` and the AFB
  application now thread `&mut Resolving` (or build a stub with `timing: None`) so a Waylay
  casualty can be *chosen* through the real question/decider path; `absorb_hits` /
  `offer_sustain` / `apply_barrage` / `anti_fighter_barrage(_at)` return `CombatError` and the
  driver surfaces it as `GameError::Combat`. The registry's `action cards` ledger row is now
  source-aware (aliases count only if the card is in the playset's sources), which the
  expansion-only aliases required. Three full-game driver tests drive the engine's own combat
  (pinned dice, `ObservingDecider` to assert the offered shape of a forced retreat); each of
  the four probe breakages (Direct Hit effect no-op, `pending_destructions` drain disabled,
  Waylay routed back to `destroy_fighters`, Rout's forced options disabled) fails the exact
  test and reverts clean. Known gaps recorded below: AFB auto-destruction stays silent
  (`destroy_fighters` emits no `SHIP_DESTROYED`, pre-existing) and the battlestation's stub
  resolver still closes SUSTAIN windows without a decider.

- Scoped roll modifiers + production window timing: `f_prototype` (marker `fighter_bonus_round`,
  consumed in `combat::effective_hits_on` and the anti-fighter barrage, fighter units only,
  2 per copy), `bunker` (marker `bunker_invasion`, +4 per copy to the planet controller's
  bombardment threshold for that invasion, `invasion::bombardment_at`), `war_machine1`–`4`
  (marker `war_machine_use`, +4 value / −1 cost = 5 faces, folded into
  `production::capacity`/`available` for the activation it was played in). The production window
  now opens **before** the step spends (`AftermathWindow::enter_production`, event
  `PRODUCTION_USED` at step entry with player+system payload, `After` relation), so a War Machine
  played there buys into the step it answers; the window refreshes the pending choice with the
  grown budget. `PRODUCTION_RESOLVED` still fires after the step. Model fields added on `Player`
  in `ti4-model` (`fighter_bonus_round`, `bunker_invasion`, `war_machine_use`), each `Vec<u32>`
  keyed by combat-round / activation seq so copies played in different rounds don't stack. Tests
  drive the engine's own paths (`roll_fleet`, `anti_fighter_barrage`, `bombardment_at`,
  `ProductionWindow` refresh, and a full `Game::step` driver for the reaction-to-window chain);
  each effect probed (break → test fails → revert). The WILD WILD Galaxy variant ("reduce the
  combined cost by 5") is not modelled; base text only.

Every batch: effect + dispatch + a test driving the engine's own path (via
`resolve_card[_loaded]` / `run`), rule text quoted in doc comments, and the gate probes
(exchange A-side infantry, pirate-fleet crew placement, scuttle goods payment — each break makes
the test fail, then reverted).

- Coexistence 7/7.1 bombardment target choice (engine plumbing, no new card): the invasion
  window now pauses on `Stage::ChoosingBombardment` and asks the table, per bombarding unit,
  whose units on a coexisting planet take that unit's hits (7, 7.1), capped per target with no
  spill (7.2). Roll-then-apply split (`roll_bombard_plan` consumes the dice; application is
  the pause-and-answer path in the window or the inline ask in the synchronous `bombardment`
  wrapper, which now takes `&mut Table`); `InvasionWindow::drive` settles before its first
  question and stops when a scoring occurrence is queued. This unblocks `fire_team` and
  `scramble` (next batch) and closed the `debug_assert!(false)` landmine `exchange_program`
  had made reachable; it also moved the ti4-sim behavioural baseline v5 → v6
  (`plans/evidence/M08-021.md`).

- Invasion-flow cards (the handoff's next group): `blitz` (at invasion start: each of the
  invader's non-fighter ships in the active system without BOMBARDMENT gains BOMBARDMENT 6 until
  the end of the invasion — `roll_bombard_plan` grants `(6, 1)` to such a ship; the Bunker −4
  penalty still applies to the blitzed roll), `disable` (at invasion start in a system holding
  ≥1 opponent PDS unit: those PDS units lose PLANETARY SHIELD and SPACE CANNON during this
  invasion — `bombardable` skips their shields and `space_cannon_offense` gates their cannons;
  the effect re-verifies the window text before marking), `parley` (after another player commits
  units to land on a planet you control: the committed units return to the space area — the
  Committing stage records `GameState.last_committed_unit` before the `UNITS_COMMITTED` emit and
  the effect hands the unit back to space before any combat), and `ghost_squad` (same window:
  move any number of your ground forces from any planet you control in the active system to any
  other planet you control — whole (planet, type) groups, re-asked with an explicit decline).
  The window rows already existed in `window_table()`; this group added the effects, the
  per-seat activation-scoped markers `Player.blitz_invasion` / `Player.disable_invasion` (the
  `bunker_invasion` / `war_machine_use` precedent — the marker lapses when the next tactical
  action begins, so no end-of-invasion cleanup), the `last_committed_unit` hand-off, and the
  `commit_on_your_planet` guard narrowing the shared UNITS_COMMITTED row to landings on a planet
  the card holder controls. Tests drive the engine's own paths (the `Game::step` driver for
  blitz/disable, the `InvasionWindow` committing-stage driver for parley/ghost squad, both with
  a cardless control arm), and each effect was probed (break → the new test fails → revert). The
  group moved the ti4-sim behavioural baseline v7 → v8 (`plans/evidence/M08-021.md`).

- Cancel API (the handoff's next group): `sabo1`–`4` (Sabotage). "When another player plays an
  action card other than 'Sabotage': cancel that action card." The machinery was already in
  place — `reactions::announce` emits `ACTION_CARD_PLAYED` through the resolver and skips the
  card's effect when the event comes back cancelled (the card is still spent: 1.15 cancels the
  event, not the spend), and the Sabotage window row already existed in the window table. This
  group added the two missing pieces: the cancellation itself (the reaction slot that owns the
  triggering `ACTION_CARD_PLAYED` event is the only code that still holds that event — a card
  effect's signature carries no event — so the slot cancels the event after a successfully
  played Sabotage; the effect-table entry exists so a played Sabotage reports as resolved
  rather than `ACTION_CARD_UNRESOLVED`), and the "other than 'Sabotage'" guard (the window row's
  guard reads the played card's alias off the event payload, so the four copies cancel other
  cards being played, not each other). Tests: `sabotage_cancels_the_card_being_played` (a
  `Game::step` driver — A plays Flank Speed in his activation's after window, B's Sabotage
  cancels the announcement, and the marker never lands; cardless control arm) and
  `sabotage_reacts_only_to_a_card_that_is_not_sabotage` (the guard at function level, via
  `playable_now`). All three halves probed (break the cancel / break the guard / remove the
  dispatch entry → the exact test fails → revert). The group moved the ti4-sim behavioural
  baseline v8 → v9 (`plans/evidence/M08-021.md`).

- Movement (the handoff's next group): `solar_flare` (all copies) and `lost_star` (Lost Star
  Chart). Both are played in the "After you activate a system" window of the owner's own tactical
  action and set an activation-scoped marker on the seat (the `blitz_invasion` / `war_machine_use`
  shape — the marker lapses when the next tactical action begins, so no cleanup). **Solar Flare**
  — "During the 'Movement' step of this tactical action, other players cannot use SPACE CANNON
  against your ships": the engine's cannon step is the one that belongs to the named action, so
  `combat::space_cannon_offense` reads the marker and suppresses the whole step (no roll, no hit,
  no `SPACE_CANNON_HITS`); every gun in that step belongs to another player and fires at the
  active player's ships, which is exactly what the card forbids. **Lost Star Chart** — "During
  this tactical action, systems that contain alpha and beta wormholes are adjacent to each
  other": a new switch `Galaxy.wormhole_star_links`, re-derived at the top of every `Game::step`
  by `laws::apply_to_galaxy` from the active player's marker (no movement path can consult a map
  that forgot the card), and `Galaxy::wormhole_partners` treats a both-wormhole system as linked
  to every other both-wormhole system while the switch is on. **On this map the effect is empty
  by the data**: 82b Mallice - Nexus is the only system carrying both an alpha and a beta
  wormhole, so a single such system has no partner; the rule is implemented as printed and pinned
  by the galaxy's own test, and the historical oracle never implemented the card either. Tests:
  `solar_flare_keeps_the_opponents_space_cannon_dark_for_the_action` (a `Game::step` driver —
  A's cruiser and B's PDS in the activated system: the control arm rolls the gun and announces
  `SPACE_CANNON_HITS`, the card arm does neither and the cruiser is still in the system when the
  action ends), `lost_star_points_the_map_at_the_chart_for_the_players_action` (the game's map
  points at the chart during the owner's action and not otherwise; the card is a resolved
  card, not `ACTION_CARD_UNRESOLVED`), `the_star_chart_reaches_the_map_through_the_active_
  players_marker` (the laws wiring: on for the active player's matching activation, off for a
  different `activation_seq`, off when another player is active), and
  `the_star_chart_rule_links_the_both_wormhole_systems` (galaxy level). Four probes (cannon
  suppression removed / the laws' flag derivation pinned off / both effect markers removed / the
  dispatch entries deleted → the exact test fails → revert); the galaxy's both-link branch is
  behaviorally indistinguishable from ordinary same-letter matching, so its pin guards against
  an over-broad implementation rather than detecting its absence. The group moved the ti4-sim
  behavioural baseline v9 → v10 (`plans/evidence/M08-021.md`) — the smallest shift of any
  re-baseline so far: the point estimates do not move and the bootstrap bounds move only in
  their last digits (the chart is inert on the base map and the flare bites only in a corner the
  bots rarely reach), with the protocol-integrity check, not the value gate, forcing the move.

- Agenda (the handoff's "agenda / turn flow" group, first sub-batch): `veto`/`veto3`/`veto4`
  (Veto) and `confusing`/`confounding` (Confusing / Confounding Legal Text). All five reuse the
  existing `AGENDA_REVEALED` / `AGENDA_RESOLVED` window rows — no new events. **Veto** — "Discard
  that agenda and reveal 1 agenda from the top of the deck; players vote on this agenda
  instead": the effect (played into the `AGENDA_REVEALED` window) draws the replacement from the
  top of the agenda deck and hands it to the driver via `GameState.agenda_veto_replacement`;
  `Game::reveal_agenda` (a new helper called from `open_next_vote`) discards the vetoed agenda and
  follows the replacement chain to the agenda that actually goes to a vote — a Veto on a Veto is
  legal and the chain is bounded by the finite deck. **Confusing** — "When you are elected as the
  outcome of an agenda: choose 1 player; that player is the elected player instead": the elected
  seat redirects the election to a chosen seat (with two players the single other seat is taken
  outright). **Confounding** — "When another player is elected: you are the elected player
  instead": the holder takes the election for itself. Both record `GameState.agenda_elected
  _override`, which `close_vote` reads after the `AGENDA_RESOLVED` window: the vote's own result
  still settles predictions and any law, but the agenda's elected-player effect and the "elected
  by an agenda" feat follow the redirect (`AGENDA_OUTCOME_REDIRECTED`). The `AGENDA_RESOLVED`
  payload gains an additive `elected_player` field, set only for a real seat, so the Confounding
  window can tell "a player was elected" from a law, a planet, or a For/Against outcome (a plain
  "outcome is not me" guard would fire on those). Tests: `veto_reveals_the_next_agenda_instead_of
  _the_vetoed_one` (driven over all three copies — the vetoed agenda is discarded, the
  replacement from the deck is voted on, the vetoed agenda is never voted, the election's outcome
  is untouched, and the card is spent), `confusing_redirects_the_election_to_a_chosen_seat`,
  `confounding_makes_the_holder_the_elected_player` (the ballots elect a; the card redirects the
  election to b, the seat recorded as elected), and `confounding_is_silent_on_an_agenda_that
  _elects_no_player` (an Elect-Planet agenda names a planet, not a seat, so the window stays
  silent and the card stays in hand). Five probes confirmed each. The group is behaviorally inert
  for the recorded ti4-sim suite — the v10 bounds still reproduce exactly — so it needed no
  re-baseline.

- Vote order (the handoff's next group): `hack` (Hack Election) — "After an agenda is
  revealed: During this agenda, you vote last." The marker `Player.hack_votes_last_agenda` (an
  `Option<u32>` on the seat in `ti4-model`, `#[serde(default)]`, in the manual `PartialEq`,
  `None` on a fresh seat) records the `agenda_seq` the card was played into: `reveal_agenda`
  bumps `agenda_seq` before its window opens, so the marker binds to the vote that reveal
  produces — including a Veto replacement voted on in the same cycle — and expires at the next
  reveal with no cleanup, the `extra_votes_agenda` precedent. `VoteWindow::new` (vote.rs) reads
  it: the order is the non-speaker seats in clockwise order, the speaker last if still voting,
  then the hackers (several keep their relative clockwise order) at the very end. The same
  rewrite fixed a latent ordering bug: the old code rotated the seated list left by one, popped
  the old first seat and re-pushed the speaker — re-seating a speaker who had been barred from
  voting (the Imperial Rider's prediction cost), which re-admitted the barred seat and dropped
  the player on its left. A barred speaker is now simply gone from the order. Tests: four
  `VoteWindow::new` unit tests (the holder last behind the speaker, several hackers keep their
  clockwise order, the marker expires with the agenda, the barred speaker is gone) plus two
  full-game drivers in `game.rs` (a three-seat agenda phase with a `RecordingDecider` that
  logs the (player, prompt) sequence: with the card b is asked in the reveal window and the
  outcome questions go to c, then the speaker a, then b; the cardless control goes b, c, a —
  same two-to-one tally, different order). Both halves probed: the hack partition disabled →
  both unit tests and the full-game test fail on the exact order; the old speaker re-seating
  restored → the barred-speaker test fails. The group moved no behavioural bound: the release
  re-baseline run reproduced all ten v11 values to the last digit, 0 metrics outside, so no
  v12 was needed (`plans/evidence/M08-021.md`).

- Combat aftermath (sub-batch C1 of the handoff's "not grouped" set): `mjets1`–`4` (Maneuvering
  Jets), `reflective` (Reflective Shielding), `courageous` (Courageous to the End) and
  `crashlanding` (Crash Landing) — the four reaction families that need live combat bookkeeping
  the model does not otherwise keep. Three in-flight model fields added in `ti4-model` (all
  `#[serde(default)]`, in-flight so excluded from `GameState` comparison, `None`/empty on a
  fresh state): `last_ship_destroyed = (system, owner, unit type)` (the announce paths record it
  before emitting `SHIP_DESTROYED` — the event payload is consumed by the timing machinery and
  invisible to effects, so the field is the hand-off), `pending_reflective_hits =
  (system, victim, hit count)` and the pre-existing `last_sustain` / `pending_destructions`
  conventions from the combat-dice batch. **Maneuvering Jets** — "When the opponent's space
  cannon hits a ship: cancel the hits": the cannon step now interleaves per gunner —
  `AftermathWindow::new` rolls one gunner's cannon, emits that gunner's `SPACE_CANNON_HITS` and
  immediately absorbs that gunner's hits — so a grant played in gunner G's window cancels G's
  hits (`combat::grant_hit_cancellation` / `spend_cancellations` in `absorb_hits_seeing`, the
  shields API). **Reflective Shielding** — "When one of your ships uses SUSTAIN DAMAGE: that ship
  is hit 2 times": both sustain-application paths (the direct `offer_sustain` and the settle
  window's Sustaining arm) now converge on `emit_sustain_used`, which records `last_sustain`
  and, after emitting `SUSTAIN_DAMAGE_USED`, drains a staged `pending_reflective_hits` through
  the real `absorb_hits_seeing` (sustain → cancellation → owner-destroy choice) when the
  producer's owner is not the holder. The When-window effect verifies the producer is the
  holder's ship — a space-cannon hit is recorded with unit `"cannon"`, so cannon damage is not
  the holder's ship and the card is silent — and stages the two hits. **Courageous to the End** —
  "When your last ship in the active system is destroyed: roll 2 dice; for each die equal or
  lower than the destroyed ship's value, the opponent chooses one of their ships in the system
  to destroy": the After-window effect infers the opponent as the other combatant, rolls
  through the effect's real resolver, and takes each successful hit through the engine's own
  `choose_casualty` (the owner chooses, no decline); losses go to `pending_destructions` (the
  Direct Hit convention) so each is announced as its own `SHIP_DESTROYED` with its own windows.
  **Crash Landing** — "When your last ship in the active system is destroyed: move 1 of your
  ground forces in the system from the space area to an eligible planet": the When-window
  effect moves one of the holder's ground-force types in space (auto-picked when the holder has
  exactly one such type, else chosen) to an eligible planet of the active system (never
  Mecatol Rex; auto-picked when exactly one, else chosen, no decline) and records
  `coexisting[planet]` when other units are already there. A bug fixed along the way: the
  `your_last_ship` guard read the `"last"` payload through the integer accessor, which returns
  `None` for a boolean payload — the window never opened for the effect; it now uses
  `event.boolean`. Four full-game scripted drivers (pinned dice, `ObservingDecider` queue with
  a cardless control arm each): mjets on a PDS-vs-cruiser fight (a degenerate combat with no
  `SPACE_COMBAT_RESOLVED` — the gun fires at the only ship present), reflective on a
  dreadnought pair (B sustains A's hit, A sustains B's, the drain makes B absorb 2), courageous
  on a four-ship B (no fighters anywhere: a destroyer's AFB barrage would consume pinned faces)
  and crashlanding on a two-ship fixture (a lone fighter in space trips the fleet-capacity
  question on the Movement step; the landed infantry coexists on the planet). The release
  re-baseline reproduced every v12 value inside its recorded bounds, `0 metric(s) outside the
  recorded bounds`, so no v13 was needed: the interleave changes scripted question order but
  not the bots' learned play inside the bounds (`plans/evidence/M08-021.md`).

- Turn/status flow (sub-batch C2 of the handoff's "not grouped" set): `summit` (Summit),
  `stability` (Political Stability), `disgrace` (Public Disgrace), `puppetsonastring`
  (Puppets on a String) and `extremeduress` (Extreme Duress) — the five cards whose moments
  live in the turn/status/strategy driver. **Model fields** (`ti4-model`, all
  `#[serde(default)]`; the marker fields are part of a seat's standing condition, so unlike
  the in-flight C1 fields they are compared in `Player`'s manual `PartialEq`): `Player
  .stability: bool` (the Political Stability marker) and `Player.duress_by: Option<PlayerId>`
  (the armed Extreme Duress holder); `TransientFlags::PUPPET_ACTION (1 << 4)`; and
  `GameState.last_strategy_choice: Option<(PlayerId, StrategyCardId)>` (in-flight, excluded
  from comparison) — the draft choice Public Disgrace rolls back. **Driver moments**: the
  strategy phase now announces its start in round 1 as well as at every round boundary
  (one-time `Game.strategy_phase_announced` flag; previously only the `RoundEnded` branch
  fired) so Summit bites on the starting hand; `finish_status_phase` fires a per-seat
  `STRATEGY_CARDS_WOULD_RETURN` (When) just before that seat's token-gain settlement; and
  `step()` fires `TURN_BEGAN` (After, payload `player` = active seat) after `start_turn`
  when the new active seat holds a readied strategy card. **Summit** — "At the start of the
  strategy phase: Gain 2 command tokens." — reuses the `STRATEGY_PHASE_BEGAN` After window
  and calls `strategy_cards::gain_tokens(..., 2)` (made `pub(crate)` for it). **Political
  Stability** — "When you would return your strategy card(s) during the status phase: Do not
  return your strategy card(s). You do not choose strategy cards during the next strategy
  phase." — the When-window effect marks the seat; 81.8 then keeps the marked seat's cards
  (readying the ones it spent, resetting `passed`) and skips the return and the report entry;
  `strategy_pick_order` / `next_strategy_picker` skip the marked seat in the following draft
  (`picks_this_round = dealt - retained`); the marker clears when that action phase begins,
  and the retained cards go back in the next round's status phase. **Public Disgrace** —
  "When another player chooses a strategy card during the strategy phase: That player must
  choose a different strategy card instead, if able." — the driver records
  `(picker, chosen card)` in `last_strategy_choice` before firing `STRATEGY_CARD_CHOSEN`;
  the effect returns the chosen card to the mat and re-asks the picker to choose from what
  the mat now holds (the returned card excluded); "if able" and a failed question both
  restore the first choice exactly (`restore_first_choice`). **Puppets on a String** —
  "At the end of a player's turn, if you have passed: Perform 1 action." — the window row
  is `PLAYER_PASSED` / After with the `actor_is` guard (only the seat that just passed is
  offered it); the effect arms `PUPPET_ACTION`, and `advance_turn` runs the puppet branch:
  the passer gets one fresh action turn (new `turn_seq`, `TURN_BEGAN`, `TURN_PUPPET:
  <seat>`), after which the advance moves on as for any passed seat. **Extreme Duress** —
  "At the start of another player's turn, if they have a readied strategy card: If that
  player's next action is not a strategic action, they discard all of their action cards,
  give you all of their trade goods, and show you all of their secret objectives." — the
  `TURN_BEGAN` After window arms `target.duress_by = holder`; the punishment is deferred to
  `Game::settle_extreme_duress(player, strategic)`, settled at every action branch of the
  driver (in the synchronous branches *after* the played card resolves and consumes, in the
  strategic branch after `begin_strategic_action`): a strategic action lifts the duress
  quietly, any other action punishes (action cards discarded, all goods to the holder, the
  target's secret objectives shown to the holder, `EXTREME_DURESS:<target>`), and passing
  neither triggers nor lifts it. Ten driver tests use a prompt-keyed `TurnDecider` (recorded
  plays as (seat, event, play-id); the action phase offers the action card first and the
  pass only once the seat's strategy cards are spent; pool questions answered with fleet):
  `summit_gains_two_command_tokens_at_the_start_of_the_strategy_phase` (paired arm/control,
  same seed: arm fleet = control fleet + 2, other pools equal, the window-time
  `ACTION_CARD_PLAYED` present only in the arm), `political_stability_keeps_the_cards_and_
  skips_the_next_draft` (marker set and 2 cards retained mid-run; `STRATEGY_CARD_CHOSEN`
  count 10 vs the control's 12 in
  `without_political_stability_every_seat_returns_and_drafts`), `public_disgrace_puts_the_
  pickers_choice_back_on_the_mat` (+ control `without_public_disgrace_the_draft_keeps_the_
  first_choice`), `puppets_on_a_string_gives_the_passer_one_fresh_action_turn` (turn_seq 2,
  active back on the passer, still passed, the card spent; control
  `without_puppets_a_pass_is_final_until_the_phase_ends`), `extreme_duress_punishes_the_
  first_nonstrategic_action` (the target plays Spy — an "Action"-window card that needs no
  galaxy and silently no-ops: goods 4 to the holder, hand emptied, `EXTREME_DURESS:a`; control
  `without_extreme_duress_an_action_keeps_the_target_whole`) and
  `extreme_duress_lifts_when_the_target_takes_a_strategic_action`. The round-1 announcement
  changed two pre-existing first-step tests to expect the `STRATEGY_PHASE_BEGAN` prefix. This
  batch moved the behavioural baseline **v12 → v13** — the largest move since v11: nine of
  the ten point estimates fell outside their v12 intervals (only `completion` is invariant),
  with `faction_differentiation` and `score_spread` narrowing (Public Disgrace scrambles the
  draft, the main source of between-game divergence, and Extreme Duress strips a punished
  seat's goods) and `vp_pace` falling (duress punishments, stability banking a card, puppet
  turns lengthen games); the v13 transcription is verified bit-identical by the debug-mode
  gate test, and the release re-run reports `0 metric(s) outside the recorded bounds`
  (dev and release recomputations are bit-identical in this batch;
  `plans/evidence/M08-021.md`).

- Salvage/repair/infiltrate/black-market/reverse-engineer (sub-batch C3 of the handoff's
  "not grouped" set — the remainder): `salvage` (Salvage), `reparations` (Reparations),
  `infiltrate` (Infiltrate), `blackmarketdealing` (Black Market Dealings) and
  `reverse_engineer` (Reverse Engineer). **Model fields** (`ti4-model`): `TransientFlags::
  BLACK_MARKET (1 << 5)`; `GameState.discarded_action_cards: Vec<ActionCardId>` (the discard
  pile the Reverse Engineer effect lifts from; `#[serde(default)]`); and three in-flight
  hand-offs (all `#[serde(default)]`, excluded from `GameState` comparison because a timing
  window's effect cannot read the payload of the event that summoned it): `last_control_
  gained` (system, planet, previous owner) recorded by the control-gain settlement before
  the owner changes, `last_combat_sides` (system, the fight's other sides) recorded next to
  the `SPACE_COMBAT_WON` emission, and `last_action_discarded` (discarder, card) recorded
  by `reactions::announce` as every action-card play converges on its discard event.
  **Driver moments**: `SPACE_COMBAT_WON` became a typed After event (winner named in the
  payload, the other sides in the hand-off) and its emission now propagates timing errors
  through the new `CombatError::Timing` variant instead of `let _ =` swallowing them;
  `finish_control_gain` records the previous owner beside the `PLANET_CONTROL_GAINED`
  payload; `TRANSACTION_OPENED` became a typed When event naming both chairs (either may
  hold the card), and the window settles before the negotiation's first question; every
  action-card play — including a cancelled one — now ends in an `ACTION_CARD_DISCARDED`
  After event and a push onto `discarded_action_cards` (steals and trade transfers are not
  discards and never touch the pile). **Salvage** — "After you win a space combat: Your
  opponent gives you all of their commodities." — the After-window effect moves each
  opponent's `commodities` (LRR 21: commodities, not the trade-good pool) to the winner's
  `commodities`. **Reparations** — "After another player gains control of a planet you
  control: Exhaust 1 planet that player controls and ready 1 planet you control." — the
  effect verifies the planet's previous owner was the holder, then exhausts a planet the
  new owner controls (auto-picked when exactly one, else chosen, no decline) and readies
  one of the holder's own. **Infiltrate** — "When you gain control of a planet: Replace
  each PDS and space dock that is on that planet with a matching unit from your
  reinforcements." — the When-window effect removes each PDS/space dock the holder has on
  the planet and re-adds a matching unit from reinforcements where the supply allows; with
  a full box that is the same unit in the unit-less model, so the driver tests pin the
  play, the spend, and an undisturbed capture (the invader's own PDS survives LRR 49, a
  rival's dies with the planet's old garrison, and a rival's planetary shield blocks the
  bombardment that takes the planet — hence the war sun in the test fixture). **Black
  Market Dealings** — "When you are negotiating a transaction: You and the other player
  may include relics, action cards, and unscored secret objectives as part of the
  transaction. This card cannot be canceled." — the When-window effect sets the
  `BLACK_MARKET` flag (cleared on trade completion and at the turn's end); while set,
  `offer_options` widens both parties' tables with flat one-good shapes for unscored
  secret objectives (`so{id}:1`) and relic fragments (`fr{trait}:1`), which `take`/
  `give` move like any other shape. **Reverse Engineer** — "After another player discards
  an action card that has a component action: Take that action card from the discard
  pile." — the coarse After row is guarded to "another player discards" and the effect
  verifies the discarder is not the holder and the card is a component action, then lifts
  it out of `discarded_action_cards` into the holder's hand. Eleven driver tests (the
  salvage pair and market pair drive real combats and transactions through
  `InvasionDecider` / `MarketDecider` prompt deciders with pinned dice; the invasion pair
  captures a planet holding the holder's own PDS while the reparations pair captures one
  the holder controls; the RE pair plays Industrial Initiative as the question-free
  component action because Spy's forced steal would rob the RE holder of the card it
  needs): `salvage_sweeps_the_losers_commodities` (+ control `without_salvage_the_losers_
  keep_their_commodities`), `reparations_exhausts_the_new_owners_planet_and_readies_yours`
  (+ control `without_reparations_the_planets_stand_where_they_stood`),
  `reparations_do_nothing_when_the_new_owner_controls_nothing`, `infiltrate_is_played_`
  `when_the_planet_changes_hands`, `black_market_dealings_puts_secrets_and_cards_on_the_
  table` (+ control `without_black_market_dealings_no_secret_or_card_shape_reaches_the_
  table`), `a_black_market_deal_moves_an_unscored_secret_objective` and the reverse-
  engineer pair `reverse_engineer_takes_a_played_component_card_out_of_the_pile` / `witho
  ut_reverse_engineer_a_played_component_card_rests_in_the_pile`. This batch moved the
  behavioural baseline **v13 → v14**: three of the ten point estimates fell outside their
  v13 intervals (`share_PRODUCTION_RESOLVED`, `share_SYSTEM_ACTIVATED`,
  `share_TACTICAL_ACTION_BEGAN` — the new `ACTION_CARD_DISCARDED` events and window
  questions dilute the stream denominators), and `faction_differentiation` /
  `score_spread` narrowed (Reverse Engineer reshuffles the action-card supply, black-
  market trades circulate cards and secrets, Salvage moves commodities for free); the v14
  transcription is verified bit-identical by the debug-mode gate test, and the release
  re-run reports `0 metric(s) outside the recorded bounds`
  (`plans/evidence/M08-021.md`).

## Partial implementations (exact gaps)

- **Choice-dependent agenda riders** (const/diplo/war family): the payoff auto-fires only when
  the chosen option is unique; multiple options → skip + comment. The tech rider stays partial.
- **Sanction**: the vote-denial half works (sentinel); the token-return half needs the ballot,
  which `resolve_predictions(state, outcome)` does not carry.
- **Mercenary contract**: the planet-card half is unmodelled (the engine does not track planet
  cards in hand).
- **Divert funding**: the deck half is unmodelled (no `technology_deck` field; a returned
  technology leaves the seat and is not restored).
- **Brilliance**: only the breakthrough-gain half is offered (the corpus has no
  technology-specialty planet marker for the ready-planet half).
- **Overrule / Strategize**: a `FreeTactical` outcome records `state.active` +
  `state.active_system`; the move and its windows belong to the driver.

## The unimplemented action cards, grouped by blocking root cause

Each window below is mapped to an engine event (Phase 8: 0 unsupported windows); the block is the
state or flow the effect needs, which lives in files outside the ownership scope. The invasion
flow group (`blitz`, `disable`, `parley`, `ghost_squad`), the Cancel API group (`sabo1`–`4`)
and the Movement group (`lost_star`, `solar_flare`), the Agenda group (`veto`/`veto3`/`veto4`,
`confusing`, `confounding`), the Turn-flow group (`deadly_plot`, `coup`, `crisis`,
`master_plan`) and the Vote-order group (`bribery`/`distinguished` via `vote::add_votes` in
`cc40c70`, `hack` in the batch above) closed with the batches above; the combat-dice group closed with the batch below (`rout`,
`dh1-4`, `waylay`; `intercept` already closed with `cc40c70`).

- **Combat dice / hit-assignment / retreat flow** (state local to `combat.rs`; the model only
  keeps per-round bookkeeping, not live dice or retreats): **done** — `rout` (marker
  `rout_round` on the defender's seat, scoped to `combat_round_seq`; the window's Announcing
  step offers the attacker `["retreat"]` only), `dh1`–`dh4` (the sustain window records
  `GameState.last_sustain = (system, victim, unit type, producer)` before emitting
  `SUSTAIN_DAMAGE_USED`; the effect stages the removal in
  `GameState.pending_destructions` and the card's resolution step drains it through the game's
  resolver, so the `SHIP_DESTROYED` event opens its own WHEN/AFTER windows) and `waylay`
  (marker `waylay_barrage_round`, self-buff on the holder's own round-1 barrage roll via the
  new per-side `ANTI_FIGHTER_BARRAGE_STARTED` event; that side's barrage hits are assigned
  like ordinary hits — SUSTAIN first, then the owner picks — instead of silently taking
  fighters). `intercept` closed earlier via `combat::grant_hit_cancellation` /
  `combat::bar_retreat` bookkeeping. `fire_team` and `scramble` left this group with the
  reroll group below.
- **Vote weighting / ballot** (`vote.rs`): done — `bribery`/`distinguished` (the `cc40c70`
  batch, via `vote::add_votes` scoped by `agenda_seq`) and `hack` (the vote-order batch above).
  The only documented gap left: a bonus whose vote is already banked when `VOTES_CAST` fires
  counts for nothing (zero-planet voter / abstainer), and the unguarded `VOTES_CAST` row also
  offers `bribery` after a non-speaker's vote (a `Guard` sees the event and the holder but not
  the seating, so "the voter is the speaker" is inexpressible in `reactions.rs`).
- **Agenda outcome redirection / agenda queue** (`game.rs`): done — `deadly_plot` (the
  `AGENDA_RESOLVED` window + the discard path in `close_vote`; see the Turn-flow group below).
- **Turn / phase driver hooks** (`game.rs`): done — `coup`, `crisis`, `master_plan` (the
  Turn-flow batch: `STRATEGIC_ACTION_BEGAN` / `TURN_PASSED` / `ACTION_COMPLETED` typed events
  and the `advance_turn` retention, skip and cancellation paths; `TransientFlags` in
  `state.rs`).
- **Production hook**: done — `war_machine1-4` (see the scoped roll modifiers batch above).
- **Event payload only** (the fact the effect needs is not in `GameState`): `lieinwait`
  (no transaction-history field to know two neighbours transacted).
- **Unmodelled attachment** (no per-card trade-good slot on `Player::action_cards`):
  `investments` (the 5-TG gain half is modelable; the "place on cards" half is not).

### Writable in a follow-up batch (state is on `GameState`, event exists)

None — the C3 group above closed every card that was writable in principle. What remains
are the two cards blocked on model gaps below: `investments` (no per-card trade-good
attachment slot on `Player::action_cards`) and `lieinwait` (no transaction-history field).
Each is a model change, not a follow-up effect batch.

## FINDING — `ti4-policy` test ledger was wrong; **resolved in `873178e`**

`ti4-policy`'s `scored_games_stay_legal_and_deterministic_across_nested_windows` failed on
`9a6fe0b` (green on `647c404`): `bot p2 was offered the secret sb it does not own
(ledger: ["faa", "pe", "syc"])`, seed 7777, rotation 0.

Diagnosis (engine verified correct):

1. The offer site (`objectives.rs::pending_choice` → `next_askable`) builds options exclusively
   from the seat's own `secret_objectives` via `secrets::scoreable_on` / `scoreable_event`.
   The engine cannot offer a player a secret it does not hold.
2. `secrets::enforce_hand_limit` (rule 45.4) returns an unscored secret **to the deck** when a
   player holds more than 3 (4 with the Obsidian). A returned secret can later be drawn by any
   player (`secrets::draw`), and the deck is also fed by the Archived Secret agenda.
3. In the failing campaign, `sb` was legally in p2's hand when the scoring window offered it;
   p2 later went over the hand limit (a 4th secret dealt by the Archived Secret agenda — an
   effect that only became reachable in the campaign because the new card effects shifted the
   trajectory) and `sb` was returned to the deck. At game end nobody holds or scored it, so the
   test's ledger — final hand ∪ `scored_by` — no longer contains it, though the offer was legal.
4. The test's premise comment, "A secret never changes hands except by scoring (61.18), so this
   is exact", is false under 45.4 + Archived Secret + any card that draws secrets (including
   `impersonation`). Disabling `impersonation`'s draw does not make the test pass — the
   trajectory shift comes from the new cards as a whole.

Suggested fix (implemented by the engine implementer in `873178e`): extend the per-seat ledger
with the secrets that seat **returned to the deck**, read from the
`"return a secret objective to the deck"` records. Final hand ∪ scored ∪ returned is exactly
"ever held", and the hidden-info net keeps its meaning. Verified: the campaign test passes
again, and the engine offer paths were re-checked to offer only the seat's own hand.

## Verification state at this checkpoint

- `cargo test -p ti4-engine --lib`: 1038 passed, 0 failed (plus the 5 doc/other targets); the
  engine-line crates all green.
- `cargo test --workspace` (LIBTORCH at `out/libtorch-2.9.1-cpu`): every engine-line crate
  green (ti4-model, ti4-content, ti4-engine, ti4-policy, ti4-sim 188/188 — including
  `fixture_capture_is_deterministic`, which was the last tracked red from the M09-019b profile
  work and now passes); **ti4-sim's behavioral suite is re-baselined to v13** for this batch:
  nine of the ten v13 point estimates fell outside their v12 intervals, so the bounds moved
  once and both the debug-mode gate test and the release re-run now report the suite inside
  the recorded v13 bounds (`plans/evidence/M08-021.md`).
- `cargo clippy -p ti4-model -p ti4-engine --all-targets`: the warning set is identical to the
  pre-batch tree (verified by stashing the batch and re-running): `effect_for` grew past 100
  lines with the five new dispatch arms and carries the same documented
  `#[allow(clippy::too_many_lines)]` convention as `apply_choice`; the remaining workspace
  warnings are pre-existing in untouched files (`production.rs` method chain, `strategy.rs` /
  `fracture.rs` casts, `close_vote`'s length in `game.rs`, the `coverage_report` example's
  length).
- The vote-order package was probed break → the exact new test fails → revert: the hack
  partition in `VoteWindow::new` disabled (both the unit order tests and the full-game driver
  fail on the exact (player, prompt) sequence) and the old speaker re-seating restored (the
  barred-speaker test fails). The Agenda group's five probes, the Movement group's four
  probes, the Sabotage group's three and the Turn-flow group's eleven were recorded at their
  own checkpoints. The combat-aftermath batch's four drivers double as the probes: with each
  effect's dispatch entry removed the scripted arm's board assertion fails exactly (the card
  never plays, the control arm still passes), and the `your_last_ship` boolean-accessor fix
  was pinned by the crashlanding driver. The turn/status-flow batch's ten drivers work the
  same way: with each card's dispatch entry removed the arm's board or event assertion fails
  exactly while the paired control arm still passes (summit is asserted as a paired
  arm-vs-control fleet delta of exactly 2 on the same seed, so an inert card cannot fake it),
  and the round-1 `STRATEGY_PHASE_BEGAN` announcement is pinned by the two pre-existing
  first-step tests. The galaxy's both-link branch has no detecting probe —
  it is indistinguishable from same-letter matching by the map's data (documented above).
- The 7 remaining unimplemented action cards (135 of 142 implemented), grouped by the
  handoff's blockers plus the cards it does not group (`fire_team`, `scramble` and the Jol-Nar
  commander reroll closed the reroll group; the invasion-flow, Cancel API, Movement, Agenda,
  Turn-flow and Vote-order groups closed with the batches above):
  - **Agenda and turn flow** (0 remaining of 9): the five agenda cards
    (`veto`/`veto3`/`veto4`, `confusing`, `confounding`) closed with the Agenda batch, and the
    four turn cards (`deadly_plot`, `coup`, `crisis`, `master_plan`) closed with the Turn-flow
    batch (new window rows, the three new typed turn events, the `TransientFlags` bitfield and
    the `advance_turn` retention/skip/cancellation paths).
  - **Vote order** (0 remaining of 3): `bribery`/`distinguished` closed with the `cc40c70`
    batch (via `vote::add_votes`) and `hack` closed with the vote-order batch (the
    `hack_votes_last_agenda` marker read by `VoteWindow::new`, plus the fix for a barred
    speaker being re-seated at the end of the order).
  - **Combat aftermath** (0 remaining of 8 aliases): `mjets1`–`4`, `reflective`,
    `courageous` and `crashlanding` closed with the combat-aftermath batch (sub-batch C1 of
    the set the handoff does not group).
  - **Turn/status flow** (0 remaining of 5): `summit`, `stability`, `disgrace`,
    `puppetsonastring` and `extremeduress` closed with the turn/status-flow batch above
    (sub-batch C2 of the set the handoff does not group) — the three new driver moments
    (round-1 `STRATEGY_PHASE_BEGAN`, per-seat `STRATEGY_CARDS_WOULD_RETURN`, `TURN_BEGAN`),
    the `stability` / `duress_by` seat markers, the `PUPPET_ACTION` flag and the
    `last_strategy_choice` hand-off.
  - **Not grouped by the handoff** (5 closed, 2 blocked): `salvage`, `reparations`,
    `infiltrate`, `blackmarketdealing` and `reverse_engineer` closed with the
    salvage/repair/infiltrate/black-market/reverse-engineer batch above (sub-batch C3);
    `investments` (unmodelled attachment) and `lieinwait` (no transaction-history field)
    stay blocked on the two root causes above.
