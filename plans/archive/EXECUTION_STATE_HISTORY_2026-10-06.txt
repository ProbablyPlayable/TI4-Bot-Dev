# Execution state

This file is the durable resume point for autonomous agents. Update it before every context
compaction, package commit, handoff, or milestone transition.

It describes **the repository as measured**, not the plan. A milestone is complete when its
behaviour is implemented, tested, and reviewed — never because a document for it exists.
The previous version of this file claimed the migration was complete; see
[`AUDIT_2026-08-11_PLAN_VS_TREE.md`](AUDIT_2026-08-11_PLAN_VS_TREE.md) for what was
actually in the tree and how the two diverged.

## Handover

See the compact handover at the end of this file, written before context compaction.

## Current position

### Base-faction completion (BF), 2026-10-02

- **All twelve base factions complete, 2026-10-05 (merge candidate `cb2374fd`).** Ledger: every
  BF faction n/n. Engine lib 2131 passed, 1 ignored. Workspace `cargo test --workspace`: all
  targets pass except `ti4-review` semantic_golden (operator: ignore) and `ti4-mlp`
  smoke_refusals (environmental: local `out/vocabulary/current.json` names no valid generation,
  so the refusal happens before the pool check). Routine soak (`--release`, 25 seeds, every 10th
  replayed): 300/300, 0 failures. TE Mecatol (tile 112) on TE boards; TE map pools
  `out/pools/full_np8_12_*_te.json`. Integration (BF20-25: roster to 18, policy roster
  versioning, sim rebaseline, UI checks, pairing soak, exit review) is not done; it follows the
  merge.

- **Current, 2026-10-05 (Claude coordinator; supersedes older notes below).** Commits `17e99108`
  (engine BF work), `5976b65c` (soak runner). Ledger: 9/12 complete; open `naaz_voltron`,
  `naazbt` (code present, end-to-end acceptance pending), `yinbt` (only Crimson's commander lacks
  a handler; Crimson out of scope), `yssarilagent` (all-seated-agent census). Engine: lib 2124
  passed, 1 ignored; integrations green. 12x200 soak: 0 failures. The other session's
  income-experiment hunks in `game.rs` stay uncommitted (not ours to commit).
- **Lean operating mode (operator, 2026-10-05).** One faction = one package = one commit. Done =
  ledger rows claimed + faction/engine tests + decision registry + routine soak (25 seeds,
  `--release`, every 10th replayed) + one Sonnet review; coordinator review only for shared
  timing/legality/hidden-information changes. One evidence section per faction (under a page), no
  handovers unless the tool changes. At most 2 Sonnet agents, one faction file each; the
  coordinator runs all builds. Workspace/policy/sim suites only at the milestone exit.
- **Next.** Close naaz/yssaril rows, then BF20-25 integration (roster to 18, policy roster
  versioning, sim rebaseline, manual UI checks, sampled pairing soak, exit review). After the 12:
  the remaining 13 factions one at a time (Titans, Nomad, Cabal; Keleres, Empyrean; Mahact,
  Nekro; Thunder's Edge last), roster migration designed for all of them at once.

- **Claude handoff, October 5 (latest measured state):** Read [HANDOVER_2026-10-05_BASE_FACTIONS_CLAUDE.md](HANDOVER_2026-10-05_BASE_FACTIONS_CLAUDE.md). HEAD d159edd8, index empty, shared dirty tree preserved. No Cargo/rustc/soak/diagnostic process active at handoff. Latest Luna workers finished source writes; new bounded soak is source-ready only, not built/run. Replayer live11/11 passes; original-six30 seeded summaries replay exactly, five old-bound event shares remain outside and bounds unchanged. BF21a seating41 passed before root changed its ordering oracle; rerun pending, default roster stillsix. Corrected casualty atomic map spans seven files (includes Sardakk), notsix. Four assets and BF20..25 remain open; Yin unsupported-grant exception unanswered. Subagent ceiling nowLuna. Handover contains full dirty-path snapshot, measured checks, ownership map and exact next commands.

- **October 5 committed bounded runners / current full green:** HEAD d159edd8 on wp/base-factions. Scoped commits c42c8638 (policy campaign preserves51pairs/102games on16workers) and d159edd8 (sim cap16, visible worker panic, complete diagnostic accounting). Index empty; unrelated shared engine/income/policy/training/UI WIP preserved. Full engine/policy/sim command exited0: engine2103 passed,1ignored; policy273 (56.22s, all canonical replaycases); sim51,1ignored; integrations1/1,4/4,5/5 and doctests passed (target/bf-oct5-closure-green.log). Final simulator51/1ignored and focused clippy exit0 after resolving new sim panic-doc/mapflatten findings; broader all-target clippy0 with inherited/shared warnings, not warning-clean.
  Maximum immediate/windowed exact fresh variants now have distinct stable IDs, same-value dedup, content-backed planet+galvanize labels and exact marker; actualthree planetary tests pass. First new fixtures incorrectly usedPOK forTE Maximum; correctedDEFAULT with runtimeassertions retained. Root independently reviewed Luna variant code and fixed three compilerissues. No Naaz ledger closure or casualty/migration commit yet.
  Original-six diagnostic ran30 fixed seeds,0errors/completion1.0, but5 event shares outside oldbounds (invasion/production/shipmoved/systemactivated/tacticalbegan); raw table target/bf-oct5-original-six-diagnostic.log. Bounds unchanged. Approved no-cargo movement affects counts/denominators, but no fullcausal or native-six equivalence claim from this sharedtree diagnostic. Follow-up example repeats30seeds and compares every deterministic GameResult summary field, excluding only wallseconds; independent Luna review found no gap, run pending. It does not claim full decision-trace identity across versions.
  One root Cargo currently active session84389: two actual BF callback/manual Gate tests in replayer live.rs (Ssruu roundtarget, copiedL1Zplanet), absolute pinned LIBTORCH D:/Projects/ti4-engine-rs/out/libtorch-2.9.1-cpu, compile4/test4, debug0/incrementalfalse/codegen4; target/bf-oct5-manual-callback.log. Luna finished writes; no agent Cargo. Tests exercise realresolver/Table/ControlledDecider/Gate park/submit/resume, not fullLiveBranch/Game tacticaldriver; groundmanual paths remain unproven. Failureguards shut down Gate. Spec-first lapse transparently recorded in evidence.
  BF-CASUALTY-STAGING.md defines exactsix-file compile-coherent migration/provenance exception; Game strictdrain optionalseparate, income/otherBF hunks excluded. No staging performed. Four asset acceptances, Yin unsupported-grant scope exception, remaining scoped commits and BF20..25 remain open. Subagent ceilingLuna strictly honored.

- **October 5 affected gate and campaign parallelization:** coordinated sim/model/policy/bridge/content/legacy command exited0: sim51+1ignored, model83, policy273 (470.21s serial tail), bridge62+6+12+3, content134, legacy25, integrations/doctests pass (target/bf-oct5-affected.log). No Cargo currently active. Luna BF-POLICY-CAMPAIGN-PARALLEL now preserves51 pairs/102games and all original assertions on a max16 scoped pool with complete canonical result slots and visible failures; root independent review fixed atomic-index lifetime. Focused new parallel test1/1 passes53.34s,272filtered (target/bf-oct5-policy-parallel.log). Full policy/lint after refactor and focused commit pending; no controlled speedup claim.
  Root BF-CHOICE-PRESENTATION fixes copied Naaz/L1Z content-backed planet names, BF-only ground damage labels and sustain target location without changing IDs/payload/order; no manual-path completion inferred. Independent Naaz rereview found planetary sustain selected a damaged first copy; root fresh-state filters + actual regression saved and propagates BF SUSTAIN_DAMAGE_USED errors. Luna now owns ONLY combat.rs exact indexed/variant menu correction and BF-NAAZ-SUSTAIN-VARIANTS evidence; root must not compile or edit that file until source-ready message. Distinct fresh galvanized/plain Maximum must not alias. Inherited non-Naaz Refit/Rearmament identity/supply changes rejected as original-six compatibility non-goals. Root owns remaining files/docs. BF20/21/22 preparation audit identified explicit old-predictor roster gating/relabel risk and fixed historical six-faction corpus/checkpoint preservation; integration not started. Remaining asset acceptance, scoped commits, manual BF choices, Yin exception and BF20..25 remain open.

- **October 5 current green engine checkpoint (Luna-only):** actual repo D:/Projects/ti4-engine-rs, branch wp/base-factions, HEAD ac296cbc. Full `cargo test -p ti4-engine -q -j4 -- --test-threads=16`: **2100 library passed,0 failed,1 ignored**, content-ID integration1/1, decision inventory4/4, other integration5/5, doctests passed. Log target/bf-oct5-engine-final.log. Registry now names actual `Game::step_aftermath_inner` observed delivery after the rollback wrapper split; traced wrapper -> inner -> ask_seeing. New copied Sol/Letnev actual Game failure/retry, Naaz nested exploration failure/retry, exact Direct Hit sustain handoff, Courageous planet removal, strict staged casualty rollback, Naaz production/effect placement and Yin own acquisition/public-score fixtures pass. These validate the entire shared working tree, not isolated commits. No asset claim or full plan completion inferred.
  One root-owned affected-crate Cargo run is active (session86199): sim/model/policy/bridge/content/legacy, compile4 for memory headroom and test16, TEST_DEBUG0/INCREMENTALfalse/CODEGEN4, LIBTORCH unset; log target/bf-oct5-affected.log. No other writer may run Cargo. Root owns shared source. Luna read-only audits: BF24 presentation, BF20/21/22 roster/schema preparation, new Naaz exact-target/placement/staged-loss fixes. Prior round reviewer corrected its original-six caveat: MODULES lists only twelve new factions, so staging_enabled is false for original-six-only games.
  BF-SIM-DIAGNOSTIC-PARALLEL implements at most16 OS-visible workers, preserving seed isolation/order; join panic now propagates instead of silently dropping chunks. Example asserts full ordered seed coverage/no game errors. Independent Luna source review found no ordering bug; explicitly a worker cap, not cross-platform physical-core detection or measured speedup. Diagnostic run and lint pending. Four ledger assets, required acceptance/atomic commits and BF20..25 remain open. Yin canonical grants retain excluded/unimplemented commander candidates; pending scope exception is not treated as approved. No external process stopped, no branch/reset/deletion/publication or new folders.

- **Latest October 5 Luna-only continuation:** operator now caps all subagents at Luna; root handles critical source review. Actual checkout D:/Projects/ti4-engine-rs, wp/base-factions, HEAD ac296cbc; no external process stopped and no commits made. Root connected copied Sol/Letnev real round producers/readers and decision registration, added bounded Game aftermath rollback after independent Luna findings, and extended Naaz survivor/Direct Hit/effect-placement closure. Full engine lib **2088 passed,0 failed,1 ignored** (2089 total,5.01s); next content-ID test failed solely on new `objective` payload vocabulary, corrected explicitly. This is NOT a completed full-engine/model gate: inventory/model/doctests have not run after that interruption, and subsequent Naaz Refit supply cap/Yin source writes need rerun. One coordinator uses test debug0/incrementalfalse/codegen4, Cargo4 (memory bounded), test16; full log target/bf-oct5-round-model.log. Current disjoint Luna tasks: actual Game round-error/retry fixtures (game.rs new tests only), Yin own canonical acquisition/sampler (yin.rs only, no excluded commander handlers), read-only remaining asset audit. Four ledger rows and BF20..25 remain open; unsupported Yin acquired effects remain an explicit scope limitation and pending exception is not assumed approved.

- **Post-quota continuation, October 5:** operator said continue after automatic-approval quota interruption and freed other memory when model engine exhausted Windows commit. No external process terminated. One complete engine-lib run compiled with test debug0/incrementalfalse/codegen4, Cargo4 jobs and16 testthreads: **2063 passed,4 failed,1 ignored** (2068 total,5.74s); four failures are new L1Z two-planet fixture setup, not accepted behavioral results. Root Naaz route/retry and corrected Jol-Nar research tests passed in this run; P01 completeness review still found missing AFB/Waylay/Reflective destruction announcements and effect source labels. Terra implements those gated to preserve no-BF original-six event streams. Luna correcting L1Z fixtures then owns new unregistered copied Sol/Letnev round-agent module; root owns shared producer/reader wiring. Root activation checkpoint + actual Game retry fixture and Naaz strict-flush log/capture fixes are WIP. All claims/commits/integration remain pending source completion, independent rereview and green tests. Canonical Yin scope exception still unanswered; no permission inferred.

- **One-hour closure run, 2026-10-04 21:01–22:01 UTC (operator authorized):** root coordinates one Cargo runner and up to three Terra-or-lower workers. Machine has 16 physical/32 logical cores; operator now permits full cores. Use `-j16` compilation and `--test-threads=16` for independent tests, lower if memory requires it. No Pi process takeover. Current split: Luna owns D: `leaders.rs` L1Z1X copied activation; Terra owns P02 copied Jol-Nar atomicity/notification/source ordering in `strategy_cards.rs` + narrow `hooks_cards.rs` seam; second Terra owns P01 destruction provenance/Courageous/legacy pending migration in combat/action-cards/Yin/reactions/model hunks. Root owns Naaz placement restrictions and Synergy error/post-agenda delivery. No worker runs Cargo/commits. Prior P01/P02 self-reviewed passing suites do not close review findings. Integration still gated by four unclaimed assets and a pending explicit Yin scope exception; no user silence is approval. Preserve unrelated WIP. HEAD ac296cbc. Wrong-checkout Luna edit discovered and stopped in C: diplomacy-worktree; inspect exact owned patch later, no deletion/reset authorized.

- **P01 Yin destroyed-ship provenance implemented (2026-10-04, Pi takeover session):** every
  `SHIP_DESTROYED` now carries a `cause`. Vocabulary and the `destroyed_during_combat` predicate
  live in `crates/ti4-engine/src/combat.rs` (`SHIP_CAUSE_COMBAT = "space_combat"`);
  `GameState::pending_destructions` is a 4-tuple so a staged destruction carries its cause to the
  announcement; the combat driver, Direct Hit, Impulse Core/Devotion, Exotrireme II state the
  combat, Nova Seed states `breakthrough:nova_seed`, Courageous states `action_card:courageous`,
  and Van Hauge inherits the cause of the destruction that opened its window. Native and copied Yin
  Brother Milor ship listeners now require combat provenance; the ground branch already did this.
  Missing `cause` is treated as *not* a combat. Evidence:
  [BF-YIN-DESTROYED-PROVENANCE.md](evidence/BF-YIN-DESTROYED-PROVENANCE.md).
  Measured: red-first proof (2 new tests failed with the gate stubbed to `true`), then Yin 35/35,
  combat 93/93, engine lib **2046 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored**, integrations 1/1 + 4/4 + 5/5,
  model 82, sim 51, policy 273, bridge 83, content 135, legacy 25; `cargo check --workspace
  --all-targets` clean; clippy has no warning pointing at the new code.
  **Not committed**: the shared files carry other sessions' uncommitted hunks, so a scoped commit
  needs hunk-ownership reconciliation first. **Tier-C review is still required and has not been
  performed**; acceptance is pending. Open, documented limitations: Courageous cannot prove a live
  combat (no live-combat indicator in `GameState`), and `ti4-review`'s frozen golden still fails at
  frame 7 — verified pre-existing by temporarily removing the `cause` key and reproducing the exact
  same failure. HEAD remains **ac296cbc**. Next safe action: tier-C review of this seam, then P02
  (Jol-Nar copied research agent) or the Courageous guard correction.

- **P02 Ssruu copies Doctor Sucaban implemented (2026-10-04, Pi takeover session):** a seat holding a
  readied Ssruu may exhaust it to take Doctor Sucaban's infantry-for-research discount when another
  seat has the agent at all, readied **or** exhausted — the printed "even if that agent is exhausted"
  clause. `strategy_cards::doctor_sucaban` now enumerates both routes through a new `sucaban_sources`
  helper (native first, then copy; a declined native offer does not close the copy), and the
  infantry-removal loop moved into `trade_infantry_for_research` so both routes share it. Native
  prompt text, option ids and the `doctor_sucaban_exhaust` decision id are unchanged; the copy uses a
  new prompt and `doctor_sucaban_borrowed_exhaust`. `leaders::modifiers()` names the copy route.
  Evidence: [BF-SSRUU-JOLNAR-RESEARCH.md](evidence/BF-SSRUU-JOLNAR-RESEARCH.md).
  Measured: red-first proof (two new tests failed with the copy branch stubbed to `false`), then
  strategy_cards 34/34, engine lib **2052 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored**, integrations 1/1 + 4/4 + 5/5,
  model 82, sim 51, policy 273, bridge 83, content 135, legacy 25; clippy has no warning pointing at
  the new code. The OBS-002a decision-delivery registry
  (`crates/ti4-engine/tests/decision_delivery_inventory.rs`) was updated for the split function —
  that gate caught the change and now passes.
  **Not committed** (same hunk-ownership reason as P01). **Tier-C review still required and not
  performed**; acceptance pending. Documented limitation: `borrowed_agent_used` is not called from this
  path because it needs a `TimingContext` that the strategy-card payment path does not have, and no
  faction currently registers that hook. HEAD remains **ac296cbc**. Next safe action: tier-C review of
  the two-route ordering, then the next dependency-ready package.

- **Pi takeover plan requested October 4:** read [HANDOVER_2026-10-04_BASE_FACTIONS_PI.md](HANDOVER_2026-10-04_BASE_FACTIONS_PI.md) for the current bounded remainder queue, copyable Pi prompt, reviewed commits/checks, original-six/scope authority, shared-checkout preservation map, review gates and exact next package (Yin combat provenance). This is documentation only; no Pi process or reviewer was launched and no implementation scope was silently changed.

- **Latest measured checkpoint / focused commits:** HEAD **ac296cbc**, branch wp/base-factions. Independently reviewed and scoped commits: **8196c7b7** Resolver rollback foundation, **d0ed0b4a** Sardakk copied tactical-end window, **96ae2aad** Muaat copied Umbat plus atomic failed choices/production, **ac296cbc** Mentak copied Pillage draws with native timing identity preserved. Staging excluded earlier commander/Alliance work and all unrelated game.rs income/training/UI experiments. Final full shared-tree `cargo test -p ti4-engine -q -j8 -- --test-threads=8`: **2043 library passed, zero failures, one ignored**, integrations1/1+inventory4/4+other5/5, doctests passed. Engine lib clippy -j8 exit0 with shared/existing warnings. All three timing/error packages and foundation have independent Terra final source acceptance; tests root-run, no isolated committed-tree build claim. Yin copied listeners/semantic fixture repair remain uncommitted; final fixtures pass, but printed during-combat restriction versus generic SHIP_DESTROYED producers needs source-provenance reconciliation before accepting/claiming. No Pi, no Cargo, no worker assumed active. Four asset rows still unclaimed; BF20..25 not started. Next bounded action: reconcile Yin copied ship combat provenance, independently review exact new listener/fixture scope, then remaining Jol-Nar/L1Z1X/Sol/Letnev and action/recursive Ssruu routes; close Naaz acceptance and Yin breakthrough dependency before integration. Keep original six compatibility and no Crimson scope.

- **Newest October 4 review checkpoint:** root continued without Pi, eight test workers. Independent Terra Sardakk review found lost aftermath retry, zero infantry supply offers, and stale copied mark; all fixed with actual production-aftermath failure/retry and zero-supply regressions, module31/31 passed, rereview no findings. Root additionally fixed Game external decision-log rollback, narrow rereview no findings. Independent Terra Muaat/Mentak review found pre-ask log checkpoints and native-first Pillage ordering/native choice identity; root fixes and same-Table/normal-order/nested-failure regressions resolve all; final source reviews accept both. ResolverCheckpoint foundation lacked owned DecisionLog; root fixed and regression1/1 passed, independent rereview no findings. Latest full run **2040 passed, two new Yin fixture failures, one ignored**; not a green gate. Luna's first fixture repair resolved ground target, but actual ship/copy-only scripts still consumed wrong choices; fresh Terra diagnosis limited to new Yin fixtures/evidence is active. Root sole Cargo coordinator, no running Cargo. HEAD66c723c6, no new commits. Final full engine/lint then focused foundation/Sardakk/Muaat/Mentak commits next; all unrelated shared work preserved. Yin source inherited SHIP_DESTROYED assumption may be broader than printed during-combat trigger; do not claim full asset acceptance without resolving event provenance.

- **Latest October 4 continuation:** operator requests no Pi and authorizes 4–8 test cores. Root completed Mentak copied Pillage timing and Sardakk copied end-tactical timing directly after Luna usage interruption; both listeners are now armed. Focused Mentak31/31, Sardakk29/29, Muaat copied-production rollback35/35 pass. Full engine `cargo test -p ti4-engine -q -j8 -- --test-threads=8`: **2034 library passed, zero failures, one ignored**, integration1/1 + inventory4/4 + other5/5, doctests passed. Sardakk Game emits precise TACTICAL_ACTION_ENDED before clearing active system, including free tactical actions, gated to relevant agent rights; native stable optional ID retained. Independent tier-C review pending for root-written shared changes; no new commit or asset closure. HEAD66c723c6. Muaat invalid system-selection regression failed for the expected incorrect successful dispatch; root fix distinguishes failed ask from valid decline; module retry **36/36 passed**. Independent Terra reviewers dispatched for Sardakk and Muaat/Mentak; Luna assigned only yin.rs plus BF-SSRUU-YIN-TIMING.md for the copied Brother Milor route. Root remains sole Cargo coordinator. No Pi/background worker active. Unrelated shared checkout changes remain preserved. This supersedes stale partial-registration statements below.

- **Latest October 4 checkpoint (supersedes older current-test/HEAD statements):** Winnu Ssruu package committed **409af6f1** and Ghost Ssruu package committed **66c723c6**, exact source hunks/evidence only; earlier hero/Alliance/commander WIP remains unstaged. Last complete affected-engine run before the next batch: **2029 lib passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored**, integration **1/1, decision inventory 4/4, 5/5**, doctests passed. Engine lib clippy exit0 with existing/shared-WIP warnings. Root fixed a real Maximum ability-production bypass using the existing cannot_produce hook's documented ability producer, and corrected actual Argent ground-unit counting. Pi operator explicitly reports done; Pi Muaat copy review/module **34/34 pass**, inherited failure atomicity assigned as separate Luna follow-up. Current three follow-ups interrupted by account usage limit: Mentak has spec/evidence and incomplete registration kept commented/unarmed; Sardakk has partial activation/registration work, root leaves incomplete copied listener commented/unregistered; Muaat error rollback code is partial/unreviewed, no acceptance. All Luna workers ended on usage-limit interruption. Root subsequently repaired partial Muaat borrowed-field assignments and disabled undefined Mentak/Sardakk listener registration; focused compilation/Muaat validation is recorded below. No background worker should be assumed active. Preserve all shared edits. Integration readiness audit corrects stale Naaz gaps and, from actual source, Yin sampler/gain-public-score triggers are still missing alongside excluded external-handler dependency. Four ledger rows remain unclaimed; don't mistake 143/147 WIP assets for completed integration. Next exact step: finish/review Muaat error fixture and Sardakk/Mentak copied timing, then coordinated focused and affected-engine validation. No higher-than-Terra subagents used.
- **Pi review refinement:** the stricter copied-production follow-up exposed a missing done_producing answer in Pi's otherwise substantive cruiser/payment fixture. Original 34/34 placed/paid correctly but legacy code swallowed final script exhaustion. Actual captured error was a redundant exhaust|muaat answer after automatic sole-planet payment/placement; root removed it and added explicit done_producing. Root subsequently added the actual invalid-after-paid-production rollback/retry regression; focused results are recorded below, independent review remains pending. Mentak/Sardakk partial listeners remain commented and unarmed after usage-limit interruption.


- **Current October 4 coordinated validation:** Pi's actual Muaat implementation has independent root tier-C source review, focused module **34/34 pass**; inherited bool-returning production-error atomicity remains an explicit parent issue (BF-SSRUU-MUAAT-REVIEW.md). Naalu/Naaz copied-agent batch **14/14 pass**. Actual Naaz invasion-route filter **4/4 pass**. Root strict copied Naaz planet choice and retry fixture **1/1 pass**; new decision site registered, nested legacy exploration errors remain separate. Cannon fixture lifetime and mistaken unit count corrected; retry pending. Full lib command encountered currently-being-written Argent/Saar patch compilation errors; these are not accepted failing rule behavior. Wait for all three agent handbacks before Cargo. Current disjoint Luna packages: Argent production timing, Ghost activation timing, Saar activation timing. Root owns Naaz/Winnu/game test/inventory review; Pi Muaat reservation honored. No new commits, HEAD cadbbe2d; shared unrelated income/training/UI edits preserved; external commander expansion remains suspended.

- **Coordinated BF work resumed (October 4):** operator confirms Pi is actively implementing Muaat's copied action; do not edit muaat.rs/evidence concurrently. Three Luna work scopes: crimson_commander_luna now exclusively Naalu copied-agent timing (cancelled Crimson never resumed); saar_bt_luna now Naaz copied-agent timing plus breakthrough-gain/production route coverage; naaz_completion_review_luna actual invasion unit-ability immunity tests in invasion.rs test module. No agents run Cargo. Root corrected production retry fixture and decoupled it from acquired Titans: final War Machine native reaction test passes **1/1**, 2001 filtered; no other Cargo active. Actual source error must roll back tactical transition and allow retry. Earlier fixture's purported red evidence was withdrawn because script had no invalid answer. Run full engine/inventory once agent patches settle, review Pi actualdiff and all new timing patches, preserve unrelated income/training/UI files. External commander work remains suspended. HEAD cadbbe2d, no new commits; no higher-than-Terra agents.
- **Manual Pi handoff requested:** operator will copy the BF-SSRUU-MUAAT-ACTION implementation prompt into their own Pi session. Root-owned controller PID19976/Pi69656 have been stopped after command-line ownership verification. Reserve factions/muaat.rs and BF-SSRUU-MUAAT-ACTION.md for the operator's Pi implementer; root must not edit them concurrently. Actual Muaat source remains native-only (no umbat_available helper); Pi wrote draft evidence prematurely describing edits/tests that do not exist. The manual prompt must require correcting evidence against the actual source diff. Earlier watchdog aborts are not proof of zero work: its truncated status snapshot misses new evidence beyond its output cap and edits to already-dirty files. Parent acceptance requires actual borrowed-dispatch/production/exhaustion tests and independent review; no Cargo is currently active. Root continues shared production-error verification and other non-overlapping in-scope work. Do not resume external commander scope or model benchmarking.
- **BF-SSRUU-MUAAT-ACTION implementation written by the operator's Pi session (no Cargo run):** the reservation was honored and the earlier premature evidence file was rewritten from the actual diff. Only `crates/ti4-engine/src/factions/muaat.rs` and `plans/evidence/BF-SSRUU-MUAAT-ACTION.md` were written; no commit, branch change, deletion, folder or formatting outside `muaat.rs` (single-file `rustfmt --edition 2024`, which changed only this package's own new hunk). `umbat_available` now exists and is the single boundary used by both `leader_action` (offer) and `umbat` (effect): native Muaat with its own readied `muaatagent`, or a currently legal `hooks_cards::borrowable_agents` right naming `muaatagent` for that caller (readied Ssruu held by the caller; source agent readied **or** exhausted). Five inline tests were added in a new "Umbat copied through Ssruu" section (offer id `component|leader|yssarilagent|muaatagent`; borrowed production for the chosen seat with payment from that seat's world; two-unit cap and cost-four limit measured from the unit delta; no-SSruu/absent-SSruu/locked-source refusals with a full `GameState` checkpoint; native path unchanged). **No test was executed**: root must run the focused `ti4-engine` lib tests for `factions::muaat` plus the affected-crate suite and clippy, then obtain the independent tier C review before this package is accepted. Root may now read `muaat.rs` again; the reservation can be released once root owns the build.
- **Operator scope correction / active implementation:** Crimson and interactions with it are explicitly outside this package. Crimson Luna worker interrupted; no Crimson edits confirmed. Earlier root expansion to all external acquired-commander handlers is suspended; reconcile Yin BT's unsupported-candidate dependency as a limitation, never claim full behavior or shrink its random pool silently. Existing external Nomad/Cabal/Titans WIP is preserved but not accepted/required completion work under this correction. Focus twelve BF factions and their shared hooks. Pi is assigned BF-SSRUU-MUAAT-ACTION with native compaction, 600s absolute/120s first-edit watchdog, exact muaat.rs plus evidence scope; controller PID 19976, Pi PID 69656, loopback 41874, target/bf-ssruu-muaat-pi-session.jsonl. This is an implementation package, not further benchmarking. No Cargo concurrently. Classic WindowsPowerShell v1.0 executable and rg --threads 1 work more reliably under resource pressure. Pending strict production-entry Game test still needs a green compile. Stop owned Pi processes after its package; preserve all unrelated edits/services and required review gates.
- **Pi compaction retry completed:** same-code local review through native Pi finished normally in **118.92 seconds**, 6319 input/9972 output tokens, zero tools/edits/errors. Model provider maxTokens/contextWindow 128000; automatic compaction enabled but zero actual compaction events in this fresh session. Correct main conclusion agrees with Luna (no demonstrated bug); additional speculative/defensive caveats are not accepted engine findings. This supersedes the earlier capped-API quality judgment. No numerical Luna speed ratio was measured. Two earlier implementation crashes still produced no patch. See BF-LOCAL-MODEL-EVALUATION-2026-10-04.md. Owned controller PID 18624 / Pi PID 87740 stopped after verifying task-specific session command lines; no local worker/Cargo command remains. HEAD cadbbe2d, no commits, baseline plan still open. Next: obtain sufficient virtual-memory headroom and verify BF-PRODUCTION-ENTRY-ERRORS regression, then continue canonical acquired commanders/Yin/Ssruu and BF-20..25; preserve unrelated experiments and review gates.

- **October 4 local-model/checkpoint update:** latest completed full engine suite was **2,000 lib passed, zero failed, one ignored (2,001 total)** plus integrations 1/1, inventory 4/4, other integration 5/5 and doctests. Cabal capacity exemption and Titans PRODUCTION listener are now WIP with focused passing fixtures; Nomad/Cabal/Titans leave ten canonical unused-faction commander handlers still missing. Subsequent strict PRODUCTION_USED error propagation and finish_tactical rollback have a red actual-Game regression but the first green compilation failed allocating memory; no green result claimed. The host has physical RAM available but virtual-memory headroom was nearly exhausted. No further Cargo run during local inference. HEAD remains cadbbe2d, no new commits.
  Endpoint 8080 now works and identifies qwen3.8-flash-next-iq3_xxs, context 131072. Owned Pi controller PID 91780 and child PID 97852, loopback 41874, session target/bf-crimson-local-session.jsonl. Full Crimson attempt ended after 98.36 seconds, 30 tool calls, one tool error, no edit/final report, with model engine exit 3221226505; the smaller one-test retry also crashed after 25.67 seconds without tools/edits. Controller incorrectly labels these completed; do not accept them. Same-code Luna review found no demonstrated production bug; initial local 1000-token reasoning attempt truncated, no-thinking retry produced three unsupported findings; 8192-token reasoning retry also hit its cap after 104.82 seconds without a final answer. Evaluation is recorded in BF-LOCAL-MODEL-EVALUATION-2026-10-04.md. Preserve raw ignored outputs and record results in BF-LOCAL-MODEL-EVALUATION-2026-10-04.md. Both owned worker processes have been stopped after identity verification; no worker/Cargo command remains active. Operator model server and unrelated processes were preserved. Controller failure classification has been corrected and three terminal-outcome checks pass, pending review.
  See BF-SSRUU-SEATED-AGENT-CENSUS.md for Luna's complete 18-source route audit. Entire BF plan, all four remaining WIP ledger gaps (naaz_voltron, naazbt, yinbt, yssarilagent), native timing and BF-20..25 integration remain open. Independent frontier gates remain pending. Preserve all unrelated experiments and never stage game.rs broadly.
- **2026-10-04 continuation (current checkpoint):** operator requests the entire BF plan, including integration; Luna agents authorized, Terra is the maximum subagent tier. Active repo D:/Projects/ti4-engine-rs, wp/base-factions, HEAD cadbbe2d; no new commits. Committed ledger remains 136/147; WIP ledger claims are not accepted completion. Shared combat/invasion/leader/Game changes remain root-owned and uncommitted. Preserve unrelated income/policy/training/UI experiments; never stage game.rs broadly.
  Latest full `cargo test -p ti4-engine -q -j1`: **1,993 lib passed, zero failed, one ignored (1,994 total); integrations 1/1, decision inventory 4/4, other integration 5/5; doctests passed**. Low-memory TEST_DEBUG=0, TEST_INCREMENTAL=false, LIBTORCH unset; one coordinated Cargo runner. This includes real Winnu delayed Warfare purge, invalid-follower retry, activation-reaction state/RNG/sequence/resolver rollback, terminal Imperial purge; strict supply and ground-event rollback/retry; native Stymie restoration; Alliance routes A/B/C/Winnu; Naaz hero Warfare secondary actual production; borrowed Nomad free flagship placement preserving general discount/credit and capacity. Focused route B ownerless grants 4/4, Winnu-prefixed real Game tests 6/6, Nomad 2/2 pass. New Nomad fixture was red then green; Naaz Warfare candidate fixture likewise. cargo clippy all-targets exited zero with warnings; root removed new Clone-on-Copy checkpoint and empty doc-line warnings afterward. Clippy is not warning-clean; new and inherited warnings need scoped reconciliation. git diff --check passes (CRLF notices only).
  Current implementation WIP also includes Naaz Maximum participation/repair/retreat/hit origin, Argent production agent with Readied gate and recipient wormhole adjacency, Naalu live views/all placement producers (agent's leftover cfg!(test) gate removed), Saar per-hit Deorbit Barrage, Yin timed hero/combat secrets, Yssaril borrowed draw/Stall transactions, Muaat actual route fixture, Alliance rights foundation and existing commander consumers. Native Stymie had been accidentally restricted by route A; restored to all-seat registration. So Ata reveal cleanup uses recipient-row presence following an automatic rejection of blanket cleanup broadening. Ground event errors no longer disappear before strict supply flush. Test-only helper functions must live inside test modules: a cfg(test) before a production helper truncates the inventory scanner.
  Inherited Claude commits reviewed by root in BF-CODEX-INHERITED-REVIEW-2026-10-04.md: sustain filter direction correct under 87.4a; 15.2a is bombardment-specific; Ambush/Devotion/Impulse Core are not unit abilities; inherited placement/release gaps were already implemented; Muaat path payload belongs to breakthrough; waiver test is not tautological; oversized wave merits constituent reviews; aggregate ten-metric agreement is diagnostic, not universal compatibility proof. Original evidence preserved with review links.
  Remaining scope: Cabal/Titans and other unsupported canonical commander effects needed by Yin's full unused-faction pool (Nomad now implemented, still pending review); full canonical Yin BT gain/public-score triggers; Ssruu copying all seated action/timing agents; complete Naaz coverage reconciliation; all BF-20..25 integration/schema/rebaseline/presentation/18-faction soak gates. Canonical pool must follow source-scoped faction sheets, not all raw leader rows or only implemented handlers. Unreferenced redcreusscommander is not a candidate. Sol's commander live ground timing is still missing; keep compatibility policy explicit rather than silently changing original-six play.
  Supplemental Luna reviews are not the required independent frontier acceptance for root-owned critical seams. No gate/completion or commit claimed. Local endpoint http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/models refused connections; no model server launched. Current agents: saar_bt_luna read-only supplemental review of strict ground/Winnu/Nomad/Naaz fixes; argent_agent_luna finished route B read review (no live registration gap, acceptance fixtures added by root). No Cargo command currently active. Next exact action: collect supplemental findings; inspect latest lint warnings in changed scopes; open BF-BORROWED-CABAL-PRODUCTION with actual exhausted-capacity tests, then Titans/remaining canonical handlers and Yin/Ssruu consumers. Before any commit, required review plus exact scoped staging excluding income/policy/training/UI experiments.

- **Operator takeover, 2026-10-03:** Claude is unavailable for the weekend; Codex is authorized
  to finish the remaining BF work, superseding the Claude/Codex edit split below. Subagents must
  stay at Terra or below. Preserve the unrelated game income, policy, training and UI experiments.
  Current committed ledger verified at ec8e957c: 133/145 across the twelve factions. All twelve
  passed 200-game seated diagnostics plus deterministic replays at e2b7d484; Saar passed again
  after its commander seam at ec8e957c. Full engine suite at ec8e957c: 1,916 passed, 1 ignored,
  integrations and doctests passed. Six-original-faction 30-seed diagnostic matches c5632448
  at all ten metrics. Evidence: BF-CODEX-SOAK-2026-10-03.md.
  The initial relic/breakthrough baseline fix passed independent Terra review and the full engine
  suite (1,919 passed, 1 ignored; integrations/doctests passed). Evidence: BF-CODEX-RELIC-BASELINE.md.
  Terra agents are implementing disjoint Naalu invasion, Yin research and Naaz combat seams.
  Next: complete remaining shared hooks and review each package; preserve game.rs income hunks.

- **Work split (operator, 2026-10-03), Claude ↔ Codex on `wp/base-factions`:**
  - **Claude owns:** all shared engine files (`crates/ti4-engine/src/*.rs` outside `factions/<alias>.rs`,
    `factions/mod.rs`, `factions/hooks_*.rs`, `tests/decision_delivery_inventory.rs`) and the faction
    files with remaining gaps: mentak, muaat, naaz, saar, argent, naalu, winnu, yin, yssaril.
  - **Codex owns:** ghost (done), sardakk and arborec (done — re-verify only), the per-faction 200-game
    seated soak harness and runs (new files only), read-only reviews of Claude's commits, evidence and
    ledger reconciliation. Codex must not edit the files Claude owns; requests go in
    `plans/evidence/BF-CODEX-REQUESTS.md` (append-only).
  - Both: commit only own paths; never touch the other session's `game.rs` income experiment hunks.

- **Handover for Codex: `plans/HANDOVER_2026-10-03_BASE_FACTIONS_CODEX.md` — read it first.**

- Plan: `plans/BASE_FACTIONS_PLAN_2026-10-02.md` — 12 factions (10 remaining base + Argent +
  Naaz-Rokha; Nekro deferred), full PoK + TE assets, Sonnet subagents orchestrated by a Claude
  coordinator, ≤ 6 at once. Pi/Qwen is no longer the default implementer (AGENTS.md).
- Branch `wp/base-factions` (from `main` 58986a6b). BF-00a (per-faction module seam, asset
  ledger, `leaders::for_faction` sheet fix) complete and reviewed: `plans/evidence/BF-00a.md`.
- BF-00l (timing + per-unit combat hooks, area hook files, fixtures, `plans/BF_AGENT_GUIDE.md`)
  complete and reviewed: `plans/evidence/BF-00l.md` (commit 85fa4155).
- Wave B (BF-00c-space, BF-00c-ground, BF-00b-economy) complete, reviewed, verified, committed:
  `plans/evidence/BF-wave-B.md`. `ti4-review` semantic_golden fails on `main` since 52066efa
  (pre-existing; regeneration needs operator approval).
- Scaffold f5bddcae: hook files movement/cards/strategy; `GameState::faction_marks`.
- Wave B2 + Sardakk + Yin committed and reviewed (no blockers): `plans/evidence/BF-wave-B2.md`.
- BF-01 + factions wave C/D committed and reviewed: `plans/evidence/BF-wave-C.md`. Ledger 92/145
  over the 12 factions. Next: shared follow-up packages listed there; two items need operator
  approval (typed SHIP_MOVED for no-cargo moves, typed SYSTEM_ACTIVATED for free tactical action).
- Codex continuation 2026-10-03: Claude advanced BF through `9a768524`, `083ff72b`, and
  `c5632448`; a clean commit check at `c5632448` passed ti4-engine (1,881 lib tests, 1 ignored;
  all integration/doc tests). The twelve-faction ledger is now 121/145 claimed; see
  `plans/evidence/BF-CODEX-2026-10-03.md` for the clean 30-seed six-faction behavior comparison.
  The retired v45 behavior gate was already outside four intervals at `274e39dd`; the approved
  event commit `9a768524` changes VP measures and raises the outside count to five. Proposed bounds
  are recorded, not applied. A focused Yssaril status-draw atomicity fix and negative test landed
  as `c79d38f3` (`plans/evidence/BF-STATUS-DRAW-ATOMIC.md`): 1,882 engine lib tests passed,
  1 ignored, integrations/doc tests passed; Terra independent review found no actionable issue.
  In the reused clean checkout, ti4-sim had 50 pass, 1 ignored, 1 missing-map-pool-fixture failure.
  Another session's uncommitted faction, game income and model/training/review edits remain separate.
  Next: let the active faction edits finish, re-run the ledger and affected tests, then close the
  remaining 22 faction assets without widening `IN_SCOPE_FACTIONS` until authorized.
- Codex Ghost Particle Synthesis follow-up `8a9e437d`: production capacity and combined-cost
    discount implemented and independently Terra-reviewed; full ti4-engine suite 1,884 passed,
    1 ignored, integrations and doctests passed. Ghost is now 11/12; the twelve-faction ledger is
    122/145 on this committed branch. See `plans/evidence/BF-ghostbt.md`. The remaining Ghost
    commander effect still needs accurate wormhole traversal and capacity timing.
- Codex Ghost completion follow-ups `dc9ea910` and `d69bba8e`: corrected
  `SHIP_MOVED.wormholes` for Quantum Entanglement and other map wormholes, then implemented Sai
  Seravus at `MOVEMENT_FINISHED`. Ghost is now 12/12 and the committed twelve-faction ledger
  123/145. Clean full ti4-engine suite: 1,889 passed, 1 ignored, integrations and doctests passed;
  live tactical movement test passed. The 30-seed six-original-faction comparison remained
  identical at every point after the shared route correction. Both packages had independent Terra
  reviews with no actionable findings. Evidence: `BF-ghostcommander-route.md` and
  `BF-ghostcommander.md`. Ghost's 200-game seated soak and plan-required frontier exit review
  remain pending; the operator prohibits subagents above Terra.
- Review note for the separate uncommitted `game.rs` gain scan: Fracture emits
    `FRACTURE_RELIC_GAINED` immediately, while the scan may emit `RELIC_GAINED` for that same
    relic at the next step; verify and prevent a duplicate Naalu Iconoclast offer before claiming
    that route. The scan is not part of the committed branch.
- Operator: ignore `ti4-review` semantic_golden.
- Blocked: typed status-phase events need `game.rs`, which carries another session's uncommitted
  edits (Arborec `mitosis`/`bio`/mech).
- After wave B: movement/wormholes (BF-00e), hidden hand (BF-00h), capture (BF-00d), then wave C.
- Ledger report: `cargo test -p ti4-engine --lib print_faction_ledger -- --ignored --nocapture`.
- Wave D, 2026-10-03 (Claude, commits `b016ae7f` `25ac5e07` `e382d476` `e2b7d484` `3af444da`):
  f77a0347 review resolved (`BF-wave-C.md`); every strategy-pool spend announces
  STRATEGY_TOKEN_SPENT; Politics Rider draws through `action_cards::draw`; production
  destinations seam (`EconomyHooks::production_destinations`). Naalu `RELIC_GAINED` replaced the
  Fracture listener (duplicate note above resolved). Ledger (12 BF factions): arborec, ghost,
  mentak, sardakk complete; argent 12/13, muaat 12/13, saar 12/13, naaz 11/13, naalu 10/13,
  winnu 10/11, yssaril 10/12, yin 8/11. Lib 1916 passed.
- Remaining BF gaps, each needs a shared seam (details in each `BF-<alias>.md`):
  argentagent (cross-player "when produces ground forces" window + adjacent-planet destinations,
  needs galaxy); winnuhero (free tactical action from a leader, `perform_leader_action`);
  naalu_flagship (commit space-area units as ground forces), naalucommander (agenda peek),
  naaluagent-te (placement events); naaz_voltron + naazbt (ability-hit immunity, planet unit in
  space combat, effect-placement gate, capture release form); muaatbt (SHIP_MOVED path,
  planet-token move, Nucleus Star Forge); saarbt (component resolver, breakthrough exhaust,
  variable resource spend); yssarilagent (all agents), yssarilbt; yinhero (ground events, all
  rivals), yincommander (player picks infantry), yinbt (alliance, out of scope).

### Structured diplomacy v2 continuation (2026-09-15)

- Claude resume point: `plans/CLAUDE_HANDOVER_2026-09-16.md`.

- Branch `codex/diplomacy-v1`; the legality/schema package remains uncommitted pending independent
  Tier-C review. Detailed handover: `plans/DIPLOMACY_HANDOVER_2026-09-15.md`; verification:
  `plans/evidence/DIPLOMACY_V2_CONTINUATION_2026-09-15.md`.
- Continuation completed seat-addressed contact IDs, typed agenda vote assurances, bounded structured
  signal features, explicit diplomacy-log-v2 / offline-v3 / observation-v3 schemas, the derived
  43-option cap, strict scoped Clippy, full affected test gates, and a 60-seed x 6-round release soak.
- Simulation reproduced inside the existing v38 behavior envelope. Its only failure is the already
  documented missing map-pool fixture; no behavioral rebaseline was performed.
- Next correctness package: remove the full append-only diplomacy journal from checkpointed
  `GameState` without truncating or weakening authenticated export/replay/reviewer evidence.
- Remaining downstream work: broader `UseLeaderFor` hooks, reviewer browser QA, paired greedy
  evaluation, fresh v3 corpus capture, BC, then PPO qualification.
- The first exploratory diplomacy PPO process stopped at its update-25 publish boundary because a
  descriptive suffix had been appended to `GIT_COMMIT`; bundle provenance requires 7–64 hexadecimal
  characters. Its `checkpoint-5988.tmp` has tensors but no manifest and is not a bundle.
- The corrected run is active as PID 77484. It starts from migrated schema-10
  `checkpoint-19280-diplomacy-v11`, uses the established faction waste penalties
  `15,12,5,5,8,8`, trains 1,000 four-round updates on CUDA, and writes to
  `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-rs/out/ppo-diplomacy-overnight-waste-20260915`. Checkpoint 240 was
  published after update 1 and reloaded identically, including its manifest. This is an experiment,
  not a qualification run. The PPO driver now has an explicit `--diplomacy` switch; without it the
  legacy rollout remains unchanged.

### Repository-wide seeded seating (2026-09-15)

- Seeded faction permutation plus rotation is now the sole game-seating contract across reviewer,
  simulation, training, evaluation, corpus capture, and diagnostics.
- The legacy scramble toggle cannot disable the contract. Evidence:
  `plans/evidence/SEEDED-SEATING-CONTRACT-2026-09-15.md`.

### OFFLINE-PILOT-SINGLE-CHECKPOINT — single-checkpoint multi-temperature capture (2026-09-14)

- Operator request: a generation run using **only**
  `out/vponly-main-20260911/checkpoints/checkpoint-236464` at various temperatures.
- Implemented in `crates/ti4-mlp/examples/capture_offline_pilot.rs`: `--single <dir>` +
  `--temperatures t1,t2,...` (default `0.25,1.0,2.5`, matching the existing greedy/standard/hot
  trio). The checkpoint loads into the current slot; unused older/evolutionary slots get inert
  deep copies so worker machinery stays uniform. Seat assignment cycles over temperatures with
  the same offset arithmetic as the mixed mode. Manifest gains additive `policy_mode` field;
  single-mode `checkpoint_manifests` has exactly one entry.
- Verified: **14/14 example tests**; determinism proven (12 games, seed base 9500001,
  workers 32 vs 1 → every data shard byte-identical); per-seat audit of 60 seats shows only
  `single_mlp_t025/t100/t250` at the requested checkpoint; clippy clean for the example.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OFFLINE_PILOT_SINGLE_CHECKPOINT.md`. Launch script ready:
  `out/launch_single_ckpt_run.ps1` (game count + fresh seed base marked at top).
- **Awaiting operator**: game count and go/no-go for the actual run on E:. Note the killed
  200k staging dirs (`pilot-retained-200k-20260913.staging-*`) are still on E: — unrelated to
  this run (different output path) but worth deleting at some point.

### LEADER-FIX-001 — deployment, unlock, and component actions (2026-09-13)

- Plan: `plans/LEADER-FIX-2026-09-13.md` package 1. Branch `codex/fix-six-faction-leaders` from
  `d38c592`. Implemented in this session on top of codex's red-first tests (uncommitted at start:
  his three tests + plan file).
- Delivered: Xxcha hero replacement resolved (`for_faction` excludes `homebrewReplacesID`; FULL
  deploys only `xxchahero-te`, PoK only `xxchahero`); commanders out of the generic offer;
  `component_actions` offers 7 implemented action leaders (xxchaagent, hacanagent, solhero,
  letnevhero, jolnarhero, l1z1xhero, **xxchahero-te** — added this session because without it the
  replacement fix would leave FULL-scope Xxcha with an inert hero and no production modifier);
  `use_leader` rewritten (was dead code) with per-arm player selections; `end_of_round` hook in
  `phase.rs::begin_next_round`; `fleet::is_unlimited` choke point for Letnev's round-limited supply;
  commander unlock refresh at decision boundaries (`game.rs::refresh_commander_unlocks`).
- Tests: **44/44 leader tests** (incl. codex's 3 red-first + 9 new), full engine suite
  **1288 passed / 0 failed**, `decision_delivery_inventory` registry updated to 7 choice sites in
  `leaders.rs::use_leader` and passing, clippy clean for ti4-engine.
- Behavioral re-baseline **v37** (versioned process): only `share_SHIP_MOVED` left its v36 interval
  ([0.046170, 0.050472] → [0.044424, 0.047795], point 0.046010) — dilution from new component
  actions + Xxcha's changed hero; all other points inside v36 intervals, completion still 1.0.
  Old/new table in `plans/evidence/M08-021.md`; **review approval requested at package exit**.
- Workspace: 2184 passed / 21 failed — all 21 pre-existing ti4-bridge golden suites (missing
  fixtures), identical failure set before this package.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/LEADER_FIX_001.md`. **Independent review pending** (required; includes
  v37 sign-off).
- **Reviewer-app fix follow-up (2026-09-14)**: `ti4-review` panicked at startup — the unlimited
  fleet sentinel (`i64::MAX`) leaked into two observation-surface paths (FleetSupply constraint,
  FleetSupplyHeadroom preview deltas) that `ti4-policy::features` encodes through an i32-bounded
  encoder. Fixed at the single choke point: `fleet.rs::UNLIMITED_FLEET_BILL = 10_000` for
  unlimited seats (far above any reachable fleet; headroom/excess arithmetic unchanged in play).
  Regression test added (`the_unlimited_fleet_bill_stays_within_printed_integers`). Verified
  through the actual app: four full `ti4-review simulate --until end` games with Letnev's hero
  active for multiple rounds (seeds 101/103/104/105) completed without error. Engine suite now
  **1289 passed / 0 failed**; ti4-policy lib 244 passed; behavior suite 5/5 within v37 bounds.
  Side observation: seed 102 is a long-but-finite game whose session exceeds ti4-review's
  pre-existing 1 GiB save limit (app limitation, not an engine defect).
- Next safe action: independent review of the package including this follow-up.

### OFFLINE-BC-PLAIN-JSONL-INPUT — plain JSONL corpora into the CUDA pipeline (2026-09-13)

- Operator-requested change, outside the M00–M13 table. Branch: `wp/offline-pilot-streaming-retention`
  (codex committed directly on top of this branch; tree was clean at start — his earlier in-flight
  files are all committed now).
- Context: codex already did half of it — `412f706` makes capture write plain `.jsonl` (no zstd),
  `fce1a54`/`40a67b7` parallelize packing/loading with a pool defaulting to
  `available_parallelism()` (32 ≥ one per physical core). This package completed the chain:
  `offline_bc.rs` still hard-coded `.jsonl.zst`, so future corpora would have been unreadable by the
  CUDA pipeline. Now: dual-format input (magic sniff) in `pack` and `train-raw-parallel`; plain
  decisions files are split into line-aligned chunks parsed/compiled on all 32 workers; packed
  `.ti4bc.zst` output contract unchanged.
- Verified: plain capture is byte-deterministic across worker counts (sha256 match, 12 games);
  pack works on both encodings (zstd regression green); `train-raw-parallel` on a plain corpus logs
  "parallel-parsing 32 decision chunks" and stops only at CUDA device resolution (this libtorch
  build is CPU-only). Clippy: zero new warnings (9 vs baseline 10).
- **Retention semantics resolved (operator, 2026-09-13)**: "6 or more is correct" — the inclusive
  `>= 6` that codex's snapshot `1820db0` introduced in current HEAD is canonical. The completed
  32k corpus and its BC model were generated under the earlier strictly-above reading (verified via
  retention.jsonl: 4,738 games at max VP == 6, none retained as standout); future corpora retain a
  strictly larger set.
- Evaluation (operator-requested): BC-32k vs checkpoint-318956 head-to-head — indistinguishable
  (VP 3.299/−1.587 vs 3.362/−1.585 over 2,160 games each direction); the BC student reproduces its
  teacher at this horizon. Log: `out/eval-bc32k-vs-ckpt318956.log`.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OFFLINE_BC_PLAIN_JSONL_INPUT.md`. Historical Python reference not
  inspected.
- Next: superseded by OFFLINE-PILOT-BUCKETED-ZSTD below (operator chose zstd + bucket folders).

### OFFLINE-PILOT-BUCKETED-ZSTD — per-reason bucket folders, zstd output (2026-09-13)

- Operator decision after measuring the plain-JSONL 32k run: E: is a mechanical HDD and each
  retained game dumps ~140 MB of uncompressed records (~95 KB/decision; this data compresses ~150×
  under zstd level 9), so generation went disk-write-bound (CPU at ~3.5/32 cores, ~1.5 games/s vs
  ~5/s). Operator chose: **zstd output + files in folders by retention reason** (`good` = standout|
  strong_table, `bad` = weak_table, `random` = random_control; `failed/` only when a game fails —
  recorded deviation) and additionally requested a **200k-game corpus**.
- Single-file change to `capture_offline_pilot.rs`: restored `JsonlZstdWriter`; parts/final shards
  per bucket folder; running-sha256 byte-exactness gate now per shard; empty buckets publish a valid
  deterministic zero-record zstd frame; manifest gains additive `buckets` stats, `shards` keyed by
  relative path, `storage_encoding = "zstd"`; each training bucket gets a scoped `manifest.json` so
  `offline_bc pack --corpus <root>/<bucket>` works directly (pack refuses corpora without one).
- Verified: build clean; **13/13 unit tests** (new `buckets_map_reasons_to_folders`); clippy at
  baseline; two 12-game runs (`--workers 32` vs `--workers 1`, seed base 9000001) → every data shard
  byte-identical across worker counts, manifests identical except legitimate `workers`/`created_utc`
  (good: decisions sha256 `5dc04ca6…3e`; bad `37243bce…dd3c`; empty random frame `6fb85438…cbd`);
  `offline_bc pack` on the `good/` bucket published successfully.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OFFLINE_PILOT_BUCKETED_ZSTD.md`. Historical Python reference not
  inspected.
- **Runs launched (supervisor script, sequential, full 32 workers each)**:
  - `E:/ti4-corpus/pilot-retained-32k-20260913-v2` — seed base `1_026_091_500` (reused from the
    killed plain-JSONL attempt; never published), ETA ~1.7 h.
  - `E:/ti4-corpus/pilot-retained-200k-20260913` — seed base `1_026_091_600` (fresh), ETA ~10 h;
    starts only after the 32k run exits 0. Logs: `out/run-bucketed-32k.log`,
    `out/run-bucketed-200k.log`; supervisor log `out/launch-bucketed-runs.log`.

### OFFLINE-PILOT-STREAMING-RETENTION — write-or-discard at game end (2026-09-13)

- Operator-requested change, outside the M00–M13 table. Branch:
  `wp/offline-pilot-streaming-retention` from `488c0bc`. Codex's in-flight dirty files remain
  untouched and uncommitted.
- Change: `capture_offline_pilot.rs` now decides retention **at game end while records are still in
  memory** (rule `vp-threshold-v1`, agreed with codex): any faction > 6 VP, or table ≥ 24 VP, or
  table < 10 VP → write frames; else seeded 5% coin (pure function of the game seed) → keep or
  discard. Discarded games write nothing to disk. Failed games are always retained for visibility.
- Also in this package: loss-alignment gate moved from a serial end-of-run shard re-parse (~0.13 ms
  per decision, ~1.8 h at 32k scale) to an in-memory pre-write check (same predicate); assembly now
  proves the published shards are byte-identical to the validated frames via running sha256;
  `file_sha` streams in 1 MiB chunks (the old whole-file read would OOM on large corpora);
  deterministic smallest-index failure reporting; `retention.jsonl` sidecar + additive manifest
  fields (`retention_rule`, `games_played`, `games_retained`, `retention_breakdown`; `games` now =
  retained count).
- Checks: 12 new unit tests pass (rule boundaries, coin determinism, ~5% rate); full `-p ti4-mlp`
  suite green; clippy no new warnings; rustfmt clean. Determinism proof: 12 games with `--workers
  32` vs `--workers 1` → byte-identical shards (decisions sha256 `038610fb…d2168377a`, games
  `d8a65c34…f4ad78479af197`) with retention active; codex's `validate_offline_corpus` passes on a
  retained corpus (finite NLL).
- Expected scale: ~13% retention from the existing 240-game block → ~4,300 retained games; current
  engine records are ~0.9 MB/game compressed (222 MB for the 240-game block), so expect a ~4–5 GB
  corpus (vs ~35 GB unfiltered). Evidence:
  `plans/evidence/OFFLINE_PILOT_STREAMING_RETENTION.md`. Historical Python reference not inspected.
- Completed: the 32,768-game run finished (`E:/ti4-corpus/pilot-retained-32k-20260913`, seed base
  `1026091400`): games phase 5,806 s + assembly/integrity 28 s; **published 5,374/32,768 games
  (16.4% retention) / 8,177,628 decisions** — above the ~13% estimate from the old-engine block.
  Codex then packed it (`E:/ti4-corpus/pilot-retained-32k-20260913-bc-v1`) and trained
  `out/offline-bc-32k-20260913-from-318956` from checkpoint-318956.

### OFFLINE-PILOT-PARALLEL-CAPTURE — parallel offline pilot capture (2026-09-13)

- Operator-requested change, outside the M00–M13 table. Branch:
  `wp/offline-pilot-parallel-capture` from `4d7f08c`. Codex's in-flight dirty files (choice.rs,
  progress.rs, reward.rs, review gui/lib, vp_sources.rs) were preserved untouched and are not
  committed by this package; the only non-example files committed are the offline-corpus examples'
  dev-dependencies (`serde`/`zstd`/`chrono` in `ti4-mlp/Cargo.toml` + lock), which the committed
  example needs to build.
- Change: `crates/ti4-mlp/examples/capture_offline_pilot.rs` now plays games on rayon's global
  pool (one thread per logical processor — 32 here; `--workers N` pins a dedicated pool of exactly
  N). Game plans are precomputed on the main thread so faction/policy assignment is identical to
  the old sequential loop; each worker chunk owns deep inference copies of both actors (`tch`
  tensors cross threads by value only, per the `build_positive_corpus` pattern); workers write
  per-game zstd frames that the main thread concatenates in game order (bounded memory at any
  corpus size). Manifest gains an additive `workers` field.
- Determinism proof: identical seeds with `--workers 1`, `--workers 8` and default (32) produce
  **byte-identical shards** (decisions sha256 `bace70e3…c3bcce9`, games `13ac4150…f1c24246ab`,
  12 games / 18520 decisions); a 64-game run's first 12 games are byte-identical to the dedicated
  12-game runs. Speed: 12 games 39.7 s (1 worker) → 9.3 s (32 workers); 64 games in 29.6 s on 32
  workers (~7× wall-clock including startup).
- Checks: build/fmt clean; clippy no new warnings (5 pre-existing in the file, all on unchanged
  code); `cargo test -p ti4-mlp` all pass (lib 99 + integration); `validate_offline_corpus.rs`
  passes on a multi-frame shard (256 decisions, finite NLL); `tools/filter_offline_corpus.py`
  consumes the new format.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OFFLINE_PILOT_PARALLEL_CAPTURE.md`. Historical Python reference not
  inspected. Review tier: routine implementation change with self-contained determinism proof;
  no legality/hidden-information/schema-migration surface touched (additive manifest field only).

### BUG-001 — Analytical and Rin exclude every unit upgrade, generic included (2026-09-12)

- Operator-requested bug fix, outside the M00–M13 table. Branch:
  `wp/bug-001-analytical-rin-upgrade-exclusion` from `main` @ `22266e1e`. The unrelated dirty
  PPO/speedup files present in the working tree were preserved untouched and are not committed
  by this package.
- Defect: Jol-Nar's **Analytical** (`waived_prerequisites`, `faction_abilities.rs`) and Rin, the
  Master's Legacy (`jolnarhero`, `leaders.rs`) derived "is a unit upgrade" from the `baseUpgrade`
  content key. The corpus has 25 UNITUPGRADE technologies; the 10 **generic** ones (`ws, sd2,
  cr2, dn2, dd2, pds2, cv2, ff2, inf2, m2`) carry no `baseUpgrade`, so Analytical waived one
  prerequisite for them (e.g. a Jol-Nar with one blue researched Carrier II, needs `BB`), and
  Rin swapped a held generic upgrade for another via the phantom `"UNITUPGRADE"` colour.
  Generated-legal, not late-rejected: `can_research`/`research` re-validate through the same
  broken gate.
- Fix: both sites now use the canonical `technology::is_unit_upgrade` (types ∋ `UNITUPGRADE`)
  already used by the AI Development Algorithm and war-sun gating; Rin's replacement pool also
  carries an explicit record-level UNITUPGRADE guard. The two pre-existing regression tests
  shared the broken `baseUpgrade` fixture selector (vacuous for the generic shape) and were
  strengthened to the canonical check; three new tests added (corpus-wide waiver census, end-to-
  end `can_research(cv2)` with one blue, Rin holds a generic upgrade untouched / hero not spent).
- Checks (post-fix, post-fmt): engine 1,276 lib + 1 + 4 + 5 integration, 0 failed; policy 244,
  0 failed; clippy: no new warnings from this package (one pre-existing `ti4-model` bool-struct
  warning remains); `rustfmt --edition 2024 --check` clean on the two changed files.
- Compatibility: the offered research set for Jol-Nar shrinks (spurious generic-upgrade options
  are no longer generated). Policies trained on pre-fix checkpoints (incl. checkpoint-132144
  reviewed 2026-09-12) carry learned priors over option ids that are no longer offered; no
  schema, choice-ID, or feature-vector change, no replay migration.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/BUG-001_ANALYTICAL_RIN_UPGRADE_EXCLUSION.md`. Spec:
  `plans/BUG-001_ANALYTICAL_RIN_UPGRADE_EXCLUSION.md`. Historical Python reference not inspected.
- Independent (frontier-tier, legality) review: **OUTSTANDING** — no review peer available this
  session; not merge-complete until it lands.

### Reviewer/current-engine integration (2026-09-11)

- Ported the session-v3 reviewer UI onto integration commit `e1ee387`, which contains the current
  Fracture activation, Thunder's Edge, anomaly, wormhole, and Wormhole Nexus mechanics.
- Restored the resolver's read-only finalized-event journal required by reviewer structured events.
- Corrected the shared empty-system assumption: reviewer selection always exposes static map
  metadata, and Fracture ingress placement retains specialty planets from empty map systems.
- No TTS or bridge file was inspected or changed. Verification is recorded in
  `plans/evidence/R01-CURRENT-ENGINE-INTEGRATION.md`.

- Historical Python repository: `D:\Projects\ti4-engine` (read-only; not behavioral acceptance)
- Historical branch: `codex/fully-learned-policy`
- Historical pinned commit: `37061c511a4780d4c0719e0342533a498cd4b457`
- Branch: `wp/phase9-production-capacity-payments` (forked from `wp/r01-review-viewer-contract`
  at `0d945e3` for the owner's three playtest bug reports; the unrelated untracked review samples
  and scripts remain untouched)

### OBS-012 — decision completeness qualification (2026-09-05)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after OBS-011 (`4b0bbaf`).
  Plan's final milestone. Per the plan's own "publish remaining exceptions rather than claiming
  blanket completeness" charter: ran what is feasible in a session, recorded the rest as explicit
  exceptions.
- Static contract, hidden-information, and equivariance gates: confirmed via existing tests that
  have run green on every commit this session (`decision_delivery_inventory.rs`'s 4 tests,
  `mlp_vectors_ignore_prompt_and_label_rewording_but_keep_stable_ids`, the M09-023/critic
  redaction tests, `obs005_opponent_slots_are_invariant_under_player_id_relabeling`) -- cited, not
  re-derived.
- Counterfactual gate: 6 of the plan's 10 listed properties spot-checked against existing
  citations; 4 (strategy-card used/ready, opponent passed/active, payment debt, cargo capacity,
  public law/agenda outcome) recorded as open rather than assumed covered.
- **Empirical separability gate actually run**: `cargo run --release -p ti4-training --example
  separability -- --checkpoint out/stage2_r6/final10000.json --games 60` against the OBS-011
  generation, 98,600 pooled decisions. Thirteen of nineteen heads fully separable (0% blind,
  ceiling 1.000). Two genuine plateaus found and reported honestly: `other` (80.4% blind, ceiling
  0.746 -- the legacy catch-all most of `content`'s ~30 still-unpreviewed subtypes fall into,
  confirming OBS-008g2/h2/h3's own finding has real, sizeable cost) and `payment` (57.7% blind,
  ceiling 0.793, not investigated further).
- **Learning and performance gate: explicitly not run.** A multi-arm pre-registered ablation at
  fixed seeds/corpus/budget is a multi-hour-to-multi-day training commitment, qualitatively beyond
  this session's scope -- named as the package's headline remaining exception rather than silently
  skipped. Distillation and PPO ablations depend on it and are likewise not run.
- Checks: no source changed, so engine/policy/training suites not re-run for this package.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-012.md` (full separability output). Spec:
  `plans/OBS-012_DECISION_COMPLETENESS_QUALIFICATION.md`. Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING.
- **Plan status**: every row of `plans/STAGE2_COMPLETE_DECISION_CONTRACT.md`'s work-package table
  has now been touched. Two honest exceptions remain open: closing `other`'s separability
  blindness (candidate-relative board facts for the content family's remaining identity-choice
  subtypes) and the learning/performance gate's multi-arm ablation sweep, both requiring dedicated
  follow-up sessions with either more design work or substantial compute budget.

### OBS-011 — vocabulary and corpus migration (2026-09-05)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after OBS-010 (`183c83b`).
  User explicitly chose to run this now (AskUserQuestion: "Run the vocabulary publish now") rather
  than keep enriching first, accepting the "families still growing" caveat.
- Ran `cargo run --release -p ti4-training --example vocabulary_discovery` against the accepted
  r6 checkpoint and train pool (both pre-existing, untouched, integrity-verified by the tool
  itself) -- the first operational (non-code-change) package this session.
- Result: 14,829 names across 44 families discovered (r6 champions 1,868, content 295, replay
  14,328 over 768/768 completed games, zero failures); published as generation `fa3d6f9...`,
  14,877 slots, `oov_registry_version: 10`, `oov_count: 48`. `critic-state` reached 221 names (up
  from 121 at the family's introduction, reflecting OBS-010's enrichment); `content` reached 134
  names (a family that did not exist before this session's OBS-008EFGHI1). All nine of the tool's
  own gates passed, including the double-build determinism check and the critic-namespace floor.
- The previous accepted generation (`e30b9165...`, `oov_registry_version: 4`, 11,147 slots) stays
  on disk unmodified; only the `current.json` pointer moved. No tracked file changed -- `out/` is
  git-ignored.
- Old-bundle backward-compatibility: not re-derived empirically, since the previous generation's
  own `oov_registry_version: 4` is a live instance of exactly the version gap
  `version_four_remains_refused_for_inference` (in `vocabulary.rs`'s existing 34-test suite,
  exercised on every OOV bump this session) already proves is refused for inference.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-011.md` (full captured tool output). Spec:
  `plans/OBS-011_VOCABULARY_CORPUS_MIGRATION.md`. Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING; flagged
  as an operational run rather than a code change.
- Next: OBS-012 (decision completeness qualification) -- the plan's final milestone, which runs
  ablations against this freshly published generation.

### OBS-010 — critic alignment (2026-09-04)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after OBS-009 (`b543dd5`).
  Rebuilds the option-free critic inventory (`critic.rs`, M09-027) from the completed actor
  information state: the module predates OBS-004a/OBS-005 and never gained either.
- New critic-local `actor_inventory_facts`: the bound seat's own relics (held/exhausted,
  per-relic readiness), exploration cards held, relic fragments, breakthrough, and leaders by
  status/identity -- mirrors OBS-004a's policy-path facts, renamed to the critic's own snake_case
  convention, unconditional (not `CriticFeatures`-gated, matching the policy path).
- New critic-local `opponent_slot_facts`: deterministic actor-relative opponent slots (victory
  points, trade goods, technologies, passed, relationship) -- mirrors OBS-005's policy-path facts.
  Added *alongside* the existing anonymized `vp_spread`/`secret_spread` aggregate, not replacing
  it: the two convey different information and existing aggregate columns stay meaningful.
- `OBS-006`'s candidate-centred board facts checked and correctly excluded: inherently
  target-specific, which the critic's founding "no fact derived from the legal set" constraint
  forbids.
- Verification: all five pre-existing critic invariant tests
  (`opponents_contribute_counts_and_never_identities`, `the_inventory_excludes_everything_
  section_four_one_forbids`, `every_critic_name_is_in_its_own_namespace`, `the_gated_groups_are_
  absent_unless_enabled`, `the_vector_is_ordered_and_deduplicated`) pass **unmodified** against
  the enlarged inventory -- real evidence the new facts respect every invariant those tests
  police, not merely an assumption.
- Checks: engine 1,208 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs (unchanged, no engine changes); policy 232
  (231 + 1 new, incl. the 102-game deterministic campaign, no regression); training 133; strict
  Clippy on engine+policy clean; targeted fmt (scoped files) + `git diff --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-010.md`. Spec: `plans/OBS-010_CRITIC_ALIGNMENT.md`. Independent
  Tier-C review OUTSTANDING; flags the aggregate-vs-slot coexistence and the OBS-006 exclusion as
  judgment calls worth checking.
- Next: OBS-011 (vocabulary and corpus migration), OBS-012 (decision completeness qualification)
  -- the plan's final two milestones. Opportunistically, further `content` previews and
  OBS-008d1's four remaining unpreviewed strategy subtypes stay open.

### OBS-009 — information-history audit (2026-09-04)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after OBS-008h3 (`c6eef2e`).
  First audit-shaped package this session, per the plan's own OBS-009 charter: check the five
  continuation-state clusters plus the general public-history question against the completed
  OBS-003/007/008 surface, then decide whether recurrence/belief features are warranted.
- Checked and found already covered: tactical action, combat, production/payment, and strategy-
  card continuation (all either durable in `GameState` or read fresh from an in-progress window's
  own struct at ask time); once-per-turn/round ability usage and agenda-prediction history are
  legality-gated, matching the plan's own instruction not to duplicate what the legal set already
  expresses.
- **Real finding**: the public vote ledger. LRR 8.2ii seats the speaker last specifically so they
  vote knowing every other vote already cast -- `Ballot` lives on `VoteWindow`, not `GameState`, so
  nothing an `Observed` built from state alone could recover it. Fixed:
  `VoteWindow::pending_choice`'s `Stage::Outcome` branch now attaches a `current_votes` payload
  (each outcome's running tally) to every option, reaching the policy through the existing generic
  `payload-number:*` pipeline with **zero policy-side code changes**.
- Conclusion: one real gap found and closed; no further recurrence/belief features warranted this
  pass. `neighbours_who_transacted`/`transacted_with` (durable, already reconstructible) is flagged
  as an unexploited feature opportunity for a future trade/relationship package, not a history gap.
- Checks: engine 1,208 lib (1,207 + 1 new, incl. `vote::` 24/24) + 4 integration + 5 docs; policy
  231 (230 + 1 new, incl. the 102-game deterministic campaign, no regression); training 133;
  strict Clippy on engine+policy clean; targeted fmt (scoped files) + `git diff --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-009.md`. Spec: `plans/OBS-009_INFORMATION_HISTORY_AUDIT.md`.
  Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING; flags the audit's own conclusion as a judgment call worth
  checking, same spirit as `OBS-008EFGHI1`'s structural-matching flag.
- Next: OBS-010 (critic alignment), OBS-011 (vocabulary/corpus migration), OBS-012 (decision
  completeness qualification) -- the plan's remaining milestones. Opportunistically, further
  `content` previews and OBS-008d1's four remaining unpreviewed strategy subtypes stay open.

### OBS-008h3 — secret-objective-count content consequence surface (2026-09-04)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after OBS-008h2 (`7894b85`).
  Fourth preview slice of `content`, closing the gap h2 flagged and deferred: three subtypes whose
  consequence is the seat's own held-secret count falling by one.
- New `Quantity::SecretObjectivesHeld` (`preview.rs`): declared alongside `ActionCardsHeld` in
  OBS-007a but never wired to a producer until now.
- `return_over_secret_hand_limit` (`secrets::enforce_hand_limit`, LRR 45.4): every return option
  previews the seat's own held-secret total (via `held_count`, so a scored secret still counts)
  falling by exactly one.
- `expedition_discard_action_card` (`thunders_edge::pay`, "action_cards" slice): every discard
  option previews the action-card count falling by one, read fresh each of the two iterations --
  reuses `ActionCardsHeld`, no new quantity needed.
- `expedition_discard_secret` (`thunders_edge::pay`, "secret" slice): every discard option previews
  the held-secret total (via `secrets::held_count`) falling by exactly one.
- Policy: `content_decision_features` gains a fifth preview quantity mapping
  (`SecretObjectivesHeld` -> `content:secret-objectives-*`) under the existing family. No new
  family, no vocabulary change.
- Checks: engine 1,207 lib (1,204 + 3 new, incl. `secrets::` 43/43, `thunders_edge::` 3/3) + 4
  integration + 5 docs; policy 230 (229 + 1 new, incl. the 102-game deterministic campaign, no
  regression); training 133; strict Clippy on engine+policy clean; targeted fmt (scoped files) +
  `git diff --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-008H3.md`. Spec:
  `plans/OBS-008H3_SECRET_OBJECTIVE_COUNT_CONSEQUENCE_SURFACE.md`. Independent Tier-C review
  OUTSTANDING.
- Next: `titan_prototype_choose_builder`/`stellar_converter_choose_target`/`crown_of_emphidia_
  choose_planet`/`dominus_orb_purge_to_move`/`neuraloop_choose_relic_to_purge` remain identity or
  permission choices without a uniform per-option quantity; trade terms and most reactions/
  action-cards remain subtype-only. OBS-008d1's four remaining unpreviewed strategy subtypes; then
  OBS-009 (information-history audit), OBS-010 (critic alignment), OBS-011 (vocabulary/corpus
  migration), OBS-012 (decision completeness qualification).

### OBS-008h2 — action-card-count content consequence surface (2026-09-04)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after OBS-008g2 (`7ba99a3`).
  Third preview slice of `content`: two subtypes whose consequence is the seat's own action-card
  count moving by one, in opposite directions.
- `discard_over_hand_limit` (`enforce_hand_limit`, LRR 2.4): every discard option previews the
  hand count falling by one, read fresh each iteration of the over-limit loop.
- `codex_take_action_card` (`codex`): every take option previews the action-card count rising by
  one, read fresh each of the card's up-to-three iterations -- first use of
  `Quantity::ActionCardsHeld`, declared since OBS-007a but never wired to a producer until now.
- Policy: `content_decision_features` gains a fourth preview quantity mapping (`ActionCardsHeld`
  -> `content:action-cards-*`) under the existing family. No new family, no vocabulary change.
- Checked and left unpreviewed: `expedition_discard_action_card`/`expedition_discard_secret`/
  `return_over_secret_hand_limit` are the same shape for secret objectives, but need a new
  `SecretObjectivesHeld` quantity -- left for a future package rather than growing this one's
  scope. `titan_prototype_choose_builder`/`stellar_converter_choose_target`/`crown_of_emphidia_
  choose_planet`/`dominus_orb_purge_to_move`/`neuraloop_choose_relic_to_purge` are identity or
  permission choices without a uniform per-option quantity.
- Checks: engine 1,204 lib (1,202 + 2 new, incl. `action_cards::` 101/101, `relics::` 28/28) + 4
  integration + 5 docs; policy 229 (228 + 1 new, incl. the 102-game deterministic campaign, no
  regression); training 133; strict Clippy on engine+policy clean; targeted fmt (scoped files) +
  `git diff --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-008H2.md`. Spec:
  `plans/OBS-008H2_ACTION_CARD_COUNT_CONSEQUENCE_SURFACE.md`. Independent Tier-C review
  OUTSTANDING.
- Next: a `SecretObjectivesHeld` quantity for the secret-hand-limit/expedition-discard subtypes;
  further opportunistic `content` previews; OBS-008d1's four remaining unpreviewed strategy
  subtypes; then OBS-009 (information-history audit), OBS-010 (critic alignment), OBS-011
  (vocabulary/corpus migration), OBS-012 (decision completeness qualification).

### OBS-008g2 — reused-quantity content consequence surface (2026-09-04)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after OBS-008f2 (`6a5985b`).
  Second preview slice of `content`: three subtypes whose consequence is exactly a quantity the
  engine already models.
- `munitions_reserves_reroll` (`space_combat_round_started`): the reroll option previews the
  trade-good pool falling by exactly `MUNITIONS_COST` -- closing a real gap, since the option's
  kind (`"ability"`) never routed through `payment_decision_features` and its 2-good cost
  previously reached no numeric feature at all.
- `peace_accords_annex` (`strategy_resolved`): every candidate uniformly previews the seat's
  controlled-planet count rising by one -- first use of `Quantity::PlanetsControlled`, declared
  since OBS-007a but never wired to a producer until now.
- `skilled_retreat_choose_system` (`skilled_retreat`): mirrors OBS-008b3's `retreat_to` exactly --
  every destination previews the seat's own ship count there rising by the fleet size leaving the
  active system.
- Policy: `content_decision_features` gains three more preview quantity mappings (`TradeGoods`,
  `PlanetsControlled`, `ShipsInSystem`) under the existing family. No new family, no vocabulary
  change.
- Checked and left unpreviewed: `orbital_drop_choose_planet`/`crashlanding_choose_ground`/
  `crashlanding_choose_planet`/`silence_choose_system` are genuine identity choices without a
  per-option quantity delta. Checked and found already covered: `orbital_drop_deploy_mech`'s kind
  already routes it through the `production` family.
- Checks: engine 1,202 lib (1,199 + 3 new, incl. `faction_abilities::` 26/26, `action_cards::`
  100/100) + 4 integration + 5 docs; policy 228 (227 + 1 new, incl. the 102-game deterministic
  campaign, no regression); training 133; strict Clippy on engine+policy clean; targeted fmt
  (scoped files) + `git diff --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-008G2.md`. Spec:
  `plans/OBS-008G2_REUSED_QUANTITY_CONSEQUENCE_SURFACE.md`. Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING.
- Next: further opportunistic previews across the remaining `content` subtypes (trade terms,
  exploration/relic outcomes, remaining reactions); OBS-008d1's four remaining unpreviewed strategy
  subtypes; then OBS-009 (information-history audit), OBS-010 (critic alignment), OBS-011
  (vocabulary/corpus migration), OBS-012 (decision completeness qualification).

### OBS-008f2 — agenda vote consequence surface (2026-09-04)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after
  OBS-008e/f/g/h/i pass 1 (`b59335c`). First preview slice of the `content` family: attaches an
  exact preview to `vote_exhaust_planet` (LRR 8.11), the one subtype of the ~39 with the cleanest
  single-quantity consequence.
- New `Quantity::Votes` (`preview.rs`): the running vote total a seat's chosen outcome would reach,
  distinct from `ConstraintKind::Votes` (an ongoing multi-pick ask's remaining allowance).
  `VoteWindow::pending_choice`'s `Stage::Planets` branch previews each planet-exhaust option's exact
  consequence, read fresh off the stage's own running total each ask (a second exhaust previews from
  the first's own total, not from zero).
- Policy: `content_decision_features` gains an `option: &ChoiceOption` parameter and now also reads
  previews, mapping `Quantity::Votes` to `content:votes-{before,after,change}` -- the same shape
  every other preview-reading family already uses. No new family, no vocabulary change (a specific
  quantity name inside an already-registered family is not itself a reserved column).
- `cast_vote`/`vote_tiebreak` (identity choices among outcomes) stay unpreviewed, matching how
  OBS-008d1 left `ready_planet`/`politics_choose_speaker`/`politics_place_agenda` unpreviewed for
  the same reason. The other ~37 `content` subtypes remain subtype/option-count only.
- Checks: engine 1,199 lib (1,198 + 1 new, incl. `vote::` 23/23) + 4 integration + 5 docs; policy
  227 (226 + 1 new, incl. the 102-game deterministic campaign, no regression); training 133; strict
  Clippy on engine+policy clean; targeted fmt (scoped files) + `git diff --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-008F2.md`. Spec:
  `plans/OBS-008F2_AGENDA_VOTE_CONSEQUENCE_SURFACE.md`. Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING.
- Next: further opportunistic previews across the remaining `content` subtypes (trade terms,
  reaction/action-card consequences, exploration/relic outcomes) where a clean single-quantity
  consequence exists; OBS-008d1's four remaining unpreviewed strategy subtypes; then OBS-009
  (information-history audit), OBS-010 (critic alignment), OBS-011 (vocabulary/corpus migration),
  OBS-012 (decision completeness qualification).

### OBS-008e/f/g/h/i (pass 1) — content decision-surface subtype (2026-09-04)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after OBS-008d2. Per user
  instruction to batch rather than over-slice, this covers five plan rows in one commit: trade (e),
  agenda (f), reactions/action-cards/faction-abilities (g), exploration/relics (h), and leaders/
  breakthroughs/remaining audit rows (i) -- mirroring OBS-008d1's "broad, shallow read, zero engine
  change" pattern.
- New `content` feature family: `content_decision_features` reads `choice.context.subtype`, matches
  ~34 fixed strings (each an existing OBS-003 `DecisionContext::new` call site) plus 5 structural
  rules (`ends_with`/`starts_with`/`contains`) for the small number of genuinely runtime-constructed
  subtype strings (relic technology picks, exploration rewards, a reaction's timing relation,
  action-card "pick" mechanics), emitting `content:subtype:*`/`content:option-count`/
  `content:optional`. No preview this pass. Zero engine changes -- every subtype already existed.
- `EXPLICIT_FIXED_FAMILIES` gains `"content"` (39 -> 40). `FAMILY_ROLES` in `projection.rs` gains
  `("content", FamilyRole::Transferable)` alphabetically between `"combat"` and `"critic-state"`
  (46 -> 47). `vocabulary.rs` migrated `OOV_REGISTRY_VERSION` 9 -> 10: new `OOV_FAMILIES_V10` (47
  entries, appending `"content"`) with a real computed fingerprint; `oov_families()` and
  `validate_versioned`'s one-version-back arm updated to 10/9; reserved-order test extended;
  `version_eight_loads_for_inference_*` renamed to `version_nine_loads_for_inference_*`, new
  `version_eight_remains_refused_for_inference` added -- the same mechanical pattern used for every
  prior family bump this session.
- Checks: engine 1,198 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs (unchanged, no engine changes); policy 226
  (224 + 2 new, incl. the 102-game deterministic campaign, no regression); training 133; strict
  Clippy on engine+policy clean; targeted fmt (scoped files, policy-only this time -- no
  `redistribute_tokens` drift to manage) + `git diff --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-008EFGHI1.md`. Spec:
  `plans/OBS-008EFGHI1_CONTENT_SUBTYPE_SURFACE.md`. Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING; flags the
  five structural subtype-matching rules as a judgment call worth checking, and notes no preview was
  attached this pass.
- Next: opportunistic preview passes for `content` subtypes and OBS-008d1's four remaining
  unpreviewed strategy subtypes; then OBS-009 (information-history audit), OBS-010 (critic
  alignment), OBS-011 (vocabulary/corpus migration), OBS-012 (decision completeness qualification).

### OBS-008d2 — strategy/technology/scoring consequence surface (2026-09-04)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after OBS-008d1 (`451eded`).
  Second slice of `OBS-008d`, closing d1's "no preview" non-goal for three of its eight subtypes.
- `gain_command_token`: each of the three pool options (`gain_tokens`, LRR 52.4) previews its own
  pool rising by exactly one, read fresh every iteration of a multi-token ask.
- `research_technology`: `research_option` (shared by `offer_research`/`paid_research`) previews
  the seat's technology count rising by exactly one regardless of price -- the resource/token bill
  stays an exact payload fact, already reaching the policy via the generic pipeline.
- `score_objective`/`score_secret_objective`: `ScoringWindow::pending_choice` previews the seat's
  own victory-point count rising by exactly one (LRR 98), capped the same way OBS-008b6's
  custodians removal already caps it; declining previews no change.
- Policy: `strategy_decision_features` now also reads previews, mapping `TacticTokens`/
  `FleetTokens`/`StrategicTokens`/`TechnologiesOwned`/`VictoryPoints` to `strategy:*` under the
  existing family. No new family, no vocabulary change.
- `place_structure`, `ready_planet`, `politics_choose_speaker`, `politics_place_agenda` are left
  without a preview this slice -- not every subtype has an equally clean single-quantity
  consequence; recorded as remaining, not silently done.
- Checks: engine 1,198 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs (incl. `strategy_cards::` 27/27); policy 224
  (includes the 102-game deterministic campaign, 339.35 s, no regression); training 133; strict
  Clippy on engine+policy clean; targeted fmt (scoped files) + `git diff --check` clean (a
  pre-existing, unrelated fmt drift in `redistribute_tokens` was left untouched, as with prior
  packages).
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-008D2.md`. Spec:
  `plans/OBS-008D2_STRATEGY_CONSEQUENCE_SURFACE.md`. Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING.
- Next: the remaining `OBS-008d` subtypes and previews; `OBS-008e/f/g/h/i` remain unblocked.

### OBS-008d1 — strategy/technology/scoring subtype surface (2026-09-04)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after OBS-008b6 (`9fd9a23`).
  First slice of `OBS-008d`, which closed OBS-008a/b's tactical and combat/invasion rows. Zero
  engine changes -- pure read of context OBS-003e already populated, no new preview.
- New `strategy_decision_features` (features.rs only), guarded on eight subtypes:
  `research_technology`, `gain_command_token`, `place_structure`, `ready_planet`,
  `politics_choose_speaker`, `politics_place_agenda`, `score_objective`,
  `score_secret_objective`. Emits `strategy:subtype:*`, `strategy:option-count`,
  `strategy:optional`. Board/unit payload these options already carry (`cost`, `cost_tokens`)
  reaches the policy through the pre-existing generic `payload-number:*` pipeline -- confirmed by
  test, not new wiring.
- New `strategy` family: `EXPLICIT_FIXED_FAMILIES` (38 -> 39), `projection::FAMILY_ROLES` (45 ->
  46, Transferable), `OOV_REGISTRY_VERSION` 8 -> 9 (`OOV_FAMILIES_V9` appends `strategy`), new
  pinned fingerprint, one-version-back window moved to v8.
- Explicit non-goal: no preview on any of these eight subtypes' options; the row's remaining
  subtypes (turn/pass mechanics, ~13 more strategy-card subtypes found while scoping, deeper
  objective-consequence facts) are not covered and are recorded as open follow-up, not silently
  claimed complete.
- Checks: engine 1,196 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs (unchanged -- no engine file touched); policy
  223 (includes the 102-game deterministic campaign, 333.54 s, no regression); training 133;
  strict Clippy on policy clean; targeted fmt (scoped files) + `git diff --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-008D1.md`. Spec:
  `plans/OBS-008D1_STRATEGY_DECISION_SUBTYPE_SURFACE.md`. Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING.
- Next: further `OBS-008d` slices for the remaining strategy-card subtypes and any previews worth
  attaching; `OBS-008e/f/g/h/i` also remain unblocked.

### OBS-008b6 — ground casualty, coexisting-combat identity, and custodians (2026-09-04)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after OBS-008b5 (`39a7c05`).
  Sixth and closing slice of `OBS-008b`. Batched per the owner's direction (three producers, one
  commit, one verification pass, instead of three more round trips) after being asked why the
  per-package ceremony was taking so long -- the fine slicing (nine packages for OBS-008a/b1-b5)
  was the fixable driver, not the plan itself.
- Ground casualty (`absorb_ground`, Rule 42): `unit`/`damaged` payload, same fix as space combat's
  casualty (OBS-008b1); reaches the already-approved `casualty-unit` family with no new wiring.
- Coexisting-combat identity (`start_next_ground_combat`, Coexistence 12): `fight|{seat}` shared
  bombardment's raw-identity leak (OBS-008b5); the `dropped`-token computation gained a
  subtype-keyed case, and `bombardment_target_features` (renamed `opponent_identity_features`) now
  handles both producers, emitting `combat:target-slot-{index}`.
- Custodians removal (27.2/27.3): "yes" previews the exact payment via `deterministic::spend`
  (OBS-007b) plus a capped `VictoryPoints` delta; "no" previews no change.
  `payment_decision_features` is admitted by subtype for `remove_custodians` (these options keep
  the `decline`/`custodians` kinds, not `pay`); a `VictoryPoints` delta arm joins its match.
- No vocabulary change; all three reuse existing families.
- Checks: engine 1,196 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs (incl. `invasion::` 44/44); policy 221
  (includes the 102-game deterministic campaign, 335.67 s, no regression); training 133; strict
  Clippy on engine+policy clean; targeted fmt (scoped files) + `git diff --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-008B6.md`. Spec:
  `plans/OBS-008B6_GROUND_COMBAT_AND_CUSTODIANS_SURFACE.md`. Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING.
- `OBS-008b` (six slices) is now closed. `OBS-008a` and `OBS-008b` together close the tactical and
  combat/invasion option-semantics rows.
- Next: `OBS-008d/e/f/g/h/i` (strategy/scoring, trade, agenda, reactions/action-cards,
  exploration/relics, leaders/breakthroughs) are all unblocked; also open, the residual
  raw-identity audit `OBS-008b5`/`b6` found but did not resolve everywhere.

### OBS-008b5 — bombardment target surface (2026-09-04)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after OBS-008b4 (`4ab638e`).
  Fifth slice of `OBS-008b`.
- The finding: `bombardment_target`'s (Coexistence 7.2) option id *is* the targeted seat's raw
  `PlayerId`, and nothing suppressed it from the generic `option:` token pipeline -- a genuine
  representation-doctrine violation (rule 3: opponent-relative slots, not player ids), not just a
  missing fact. A policy could in principle key on a literal seat label that is arbitrary per game.
- Engine: `bombardment_target_question` gains a `system` parameter and attaches `system`/`planet`
  payload (this decision previously carried none at all); both call sites updated.
- Policy fix: `explicit_option_features_with`'s `dropped`-token set, which already strips a board
  identity out of a composite `verb|argument` id's argument half, gains a `bombardment_target`
  case that drops the option's *whole* id -- there is no `verb|argument` split here, the whole id
  is the identity, and since `dropped` filters the combined id-and-label token set this also
  removes the seat from the label ("b's units"), not just the id.
- Replacement fact: new `bombardment_target_features` maps the option id to its
  `seen.opponent_slots(player)` position (OBS-005) and emits `combat:target-slot-{index}` under
  the existing `combat` family. No new family, no vocabulary change.
- Scope boundary: fixed only for this one confirmed producer. A grep during scoping found
  `.as_str()` beside `ChoiceOption::labelled` in roughly twenty engine files; whether any other
  producer shares this pattern is not established and is recorded as a residual for a dedicated
  audit, not silently fixed everywhere here.
- Checks: engine 1,195 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs (incl. `invasion::` 43/43); policy 220
  (includes the 102-game deterministic campaign, 337.24 s, no regression); training 133; strict
  Clippy on engine+policy clean; targeted fmt (scoped files) + `git diff --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-008B5.md`. Spec: `plans/OBS-008B5_BOMBARDMENT_TARGET_SURFACE.md`.
  Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING -- flagged in the evidence as a priority review item since
  it touches the shared tokenizer.
- Next: the rest of `OBS-008b` -- ground casualty (Rule 42), fight-ground-combat-round,
  start-next-ground-combat, and custodians removal. Also open: the residual raw-identity audit
  this package's scoping surfaced but did not resolve.

### OBS-008b4 — sustain-damage consequence surface (2026-09-04)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after the Codex integration
  commit (`7315f97`), itself after OBS-008b3 (`93839d9`). Fourth slice of `OBS-008b`.
- The gap: OBS-008b1 gave casualty and sustain options their `unit` identity but attached no
  preview to either -- sustain was the one option kind left with no consequence fact at all.
- Interrupted mid-implementation by a concurrent Codex session editing the same tree; the
  in-progress diff was cleanly separated (verified independently on both sides), Codex's work
  committed first (`7315f97`), and this slice reapplied and completed on the clean base. See that
  commit's own entry above for what it changed.
- Engine: `offer_sustain` and the windowed `Stage::Sustaining` (its long-standing duplicate) each
  attach `Preview::certain([ShipsInSystem])`, computed once per ask: sustaining previews no
  change (the ship survives, damaged); declining previews the seat's own ship count falling by
  exactly one (the ship is destroyed).
- Policy: `combat_decision_features`'s subtype guard now also accepts `sustain_damage`; the
  existing `ShipsInSystem -> "ships"` mapping (OBS-008b3) needed no change. No new family, no
  vocabulary change.
- Checks: engine 1,194 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs (incl. `combat::` 54/54); policy 219 (includes
  the 102-game deterministic campaign, 338.05 s, no regression); training 133; strict Clippy on
  engine+policy clean; targeted fmt (scoped files) + `git diff --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-008B4.md`. Spec:
  `plans/OBS-008B4_SUSTAIN_CONSEQUENCE_SURFACE.md`. Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING.
- Next: the rest of `OBS-008b` -- bombardment, ground casualty (Rule 42), fight-ground-combat-
  round, start-next-ground-combat, and custodians removal.

### Codex pass: action-card decision attribution, a preview correctness fix, and actor-inventory identity (2026-09-04)

- Authored by a concurrent Codex session working the same tree (branch
  `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`) alongside this one, landed after OBS-008b3
  (`93839d9`). This session did not author it; it is recorded here from reading the diff, for the
  same reason every other package's evidence is recorded, and reformatted to the project's pinned
  `rustfmt` before commit (the source tree's own formatting did not match). User-confirmed
  reviewed and accepted.
- `action_cards.rs` gains a resolver-local `with_action_card_source`/`active_action_card` (a
  thread-local, not game state, so the identity cannot leak into a later timing window or replay
  position) recording which action card is currently executing through `reactions::announce`.
  `choose_reroll_dice` and `choose_casualty` (`combat.rs`) each gain `source`/`subtype` (and
  `choose_casualty` a `target`) parameters instead of a hardcoded `Rule("78.3")`/`Rule("78.4")`, so
  Fire Team's reroll, Courageous to the End's casualty, the Jol-Nar Commander's and Crown of
  Thalnos's (relic and law) rerolls, and `pick`'s many action-card asks each carry their real card
  identity as `DecisionSource::ActionCard`/`DecisionSource::Content` and a card-specific subtype.
  Every base-rule call site (78.3/78.4/78.7/78.9/82's own producers) passes the prior hardcoded
  values explicitly, so no non-action-card decision's context changes.
- `tactical::preview_moves` (this session's own OBS-008a2) is corrected: a move whose route exits
  a gravity rift can destroy the ship in transit (41.2), so `Preview::certain` was wrong for that
  case. The fix takes an added `galaxy` parameter, re-derives the route, and downgrades to
  `Preview::unknown("gravity-rift survival is unresolved")` when the route exits one. A real,
  accepted bug fix to committed work, not new work of this package's own.
- `invasion::commit_options` (OBS-008a4) is corrected in the same spirit: the previewed
  `GroundForcesOnPlanet` count now filters `on_planet_of` to actual ground forces, since a
  structure (a PDS) the invader owns on the target planet was previously counted as if it were one
  of their landed ground forces.
- `actor_inventory_facts` (`ti4-engine-rs-23`'s OBS-004a) changes from closed readiness/count
  buckets only to also emitting open per-alias identity facts —
  `actor-inventory:relic:{alias}:{readiness}`, `:exploration:{card}`, `:breakthrough:{alias}`,
  `:leader:{alias}:{status}` — and replaces the doc comment that stated the closed-bucket design
  was deliberate ("an open per-alias family would be the identity-crossing this package
  deliberately avoids") with a rationale for the opposite design (a ready Crown and a ready
  Sceptre need to stay legally distinguishable, not collapsed into one count). This contradicts
  `plans/OBS-004A_ACTOR_PRIVATE_INVENTORY.md`'s stated position and was raised directly to the user
  before commit; the user confirmed it is reviewed and to continue. `OBS-004A_ACTOR_PRIVATE_
  INVENTORY.md` itself is not yet updated to match — still says closed-bucket-only.
- Checks (after this session's own reformat to the pinned `rustfmt`): engine 1,193 lib + 4
  integration + 5 docs (no new tests — Codex's existing-test call sites were adapted to the new
  signatures, not extended); policy 218 (includes the 102-game deterministic campaign, run twice
  clean at 339.81 s and 326.80 s); training 133; strict Clippy on engine+policy clean; `rustfmt
  --check` and `git diff --check` clean after reformatting.
- Not evidenced or spec'd the way this session's own OBS-008 packages are — no
  `plans/evidence/*.md` exists for it, since it is not this session's design. Independent Tier-C
  review status: per the user, reviewed and accepted.

### OBS-008b3 — retreat fleet-arrival surface (2026-09-04)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after OBS-008b2 (`4b9c383`).
  Third slice of `OBS-008b`.
- The gap: `announce_retreat`'s "stay"/"retreat" and `retreat_to`'s destination options carried no
  payload at all -- not even the generic `option-system:*` board-fact pipeline reached them, since
  it fires only when an option names a `system`. These were the only combat producers exposing
  nothing beyond option ID and label.
- Engine: `Announcing` now attaches `system` and a `ShipsInSystem` preview to "stay" (no change)
  and "retreat"/the forced retreat (the asking seat's own count there falling to zero -- 78.7
  retreats the whole fleet together, never selectively). `Retreating` attaches `system` and a
  `ShipsInSystem` preview to each destination: its own existing count there, to that count plus
  the whole retreating fleet's size, read once per choice via `ships_of`.
- Attaching `system` also activates the pre-existing, already-approved `option-system:*` family
  through the generic board-fact pipeline -- no further wiring, the same mechanism OBS-008b1's
  `unit` payload activated for `casualty-unit`.
- Policy: `combat_decision_features`'s subtype guard now also accepts `announce_retreat`/
  `retreat_to`; a `ShipsInSystem -> "ships"` mapping joins the existing delta match, sharing
  `combat:ships-*` between the departure and arrival facts. No new family, no vocabulary change.
- Checks: engine 1,193 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs (incl. `combat::` 53/53); policy 218 (includes
  the 102-game deterministic campaign, 291.07 s -- back within the 260-310 s range, confirming
  b1/b2's ~350-358 s readings were transient system load); training 133; strict Clippy on
  engine+policy clean; targeted fmt (scoped files) + `git diff --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-008B3.md`. Spec:
  `plans/OBS-008B3_RETREAT_FLEET_ARRIVAL_SURFACE.md`. Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING.
- Next: the rest of `OBS-008b` -- sustain damage's own consequence preview (b1 only fixed its
  identity), bombardment, ground casualty (Rule 42), fight-ground-combat-round,
  start-next-ground-combat, and custodians removal.

### OBS-008b2 — reroll-die stochastic surface (2026-09-04)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after OBS-008b1 (`aab65bc`).
  Second slice of `OBS-008b`. First package to connect OBS-007c's stochastic preview foundation
  (`hit_count_preview`, deliberately built with "no producer attaches this yet") to a real
  producer.
- `preview::Quantity` gains `Hits`: hits one roll (or one die) produces, before any casualty is
  assigned. Producer-specific meaning downstream; the count itself is what is named.
- Engine: `combat::choose_reroll_dice` computes each die's current hit status (face plus any
  per-die adjustment still on that position -- the same arithmetic `RerollEntry::hits` sums per
  entry, applied per-die) and attaches: to the reroll option, `unit`/`face`/`hits_on` payload plus
  `stochastic::hit_count_preview(1, hits_on, ...)` -- exact because a redraw clears the die's
  adjustment along with its face, so the post-reroll distribution is precisely the uniform
  threshold roll the helper models; to the decline option, the same `unit` payload and a certain,
  unchanged fact instead of the reroll's chance. Both omitted when `hits_on` is `None`.
- Policy: new `combat_decision_features` (guarded on subtype `reroll_die`) mirrors the tactical
  surface for `Certain` outcomes and adds the first read of a `Chanced` outcome's exact expected
  value (`Preview::expected`) as `combat:hits-expected` -- the full per-case breakdown remains
  deliberately unexposed as features this slice.
- `combat` is a genuinely new family (not a `tactical` reuse): `EXPLICIT_FIXED_FAMILIES` (37 ->
  38), `projection::FAMILY_ROLES` (44 -> 45, Transferable), and `OOV_REGISTRY_VERSION` 7 -> 8
  (`OOV_FAMILIES_V8` appends `combat`), new pinned fingerprint, one-version-back window moved to
  v7.
- Checks: engine 1,192 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs (incl. `combat::` 52/52); policy 217 (includes
  the 102-game deterministic campaign, 357.94 s -- consistent with OBS-008b1's 349.95 s, so this
  confirms a workstream-wide wall-clock shift rather than a per-package regression); training 133;
  `ti4-mlp` 97/98 -- the one failure (`a_pool_without_an_allowed_manifest_role_is_refused`)
  reproduces identically at the prior commit `aab65bc`, confirmed pre-existing and unrelated
  before committing; strict Clippy on engine+policy clean; targeted fmt (scoped files) +
  `git diff --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-008B2.md`. Spec:
  `plans/OBS-008B2_REROLL_DIE_STOCHASTIC_SURFACE.md`. Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING.
- Next: the rest of `OBS-008b` -- retreat (announce/destination), sustain damage's own preview
  (declined today, unlike casualty/sustain's b1 identity fix), bombardment, ground casualty
  (Rule 42), fight-ground-combat-round, start-next-ground-combat, and custodians removal.

### OBS-008b1 — casualty and sustain unit-identity surface (2026-09-04)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after OBS-008a4 (`1b55fe6`).
  First slice of `OBS-008b` (combat and invasion options). `OBS-008a` (`a1`-`a4`) is complete.
- The gap: under the completed prompt-free contract (OBS-003i), a casualty/sustain option's
  identity was `destroy|0`/`sustain|1` -- a bare index with no structured content once the display
  label (the only place the unit type appeared) is dropped. Two such options were indistinguishable
  to the policy.
- Engine: both casualty-building sites (`choose_casualty`, and `CombatWindow::pending_choice`'s
  duplicated `Assigning` stage) now attach `.with("unit", type_id).with("damaged",
  sustained_damage)`. Both sustain-building sites (`offer_sustain`, `Sustaining` stage) attach
  `.with("unit", type_id)` only -- every sustain candidate is undamaged by the filter, so `damaged`
  would always read false and carry no information.
- No new `features.rs` wiring: `canonical_feature_kind` already maps both raw kinds to canonical
  `"casualty"`, and `structured_features`'s existing generic unit-payload tail already fires once
  the payload exists. This package supplied only the missing payload.
- `casualty-unit` joins `projection::APPROVED_UNIT_FAMILIES` (5 -> 6), resolving to the
  pre-existing shared `*-unit` reserved OOV column every other approved unit family already
  shares -- no new column, no registry version bump. This is the architecture-review decision the
  family's own doc comment calls for, made under the standing "continue, review deferred"
  instruction.
- Checks: engine 1,191 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs (incl. `combat::` 51/51, all pre-existing green
  through the four call-site changes); policy 215 (includes the 102-game deterministic campaign,
  349.95 s -- the highest wall-clock this workstream has measured, above the prior 260-310 s
  range; 0 test failures, reported as a timing observation rather than a "no regression" claim);
  training 133; strict Clippy on engine+policy clean; targeted fmt (scoped files) +
  `git diff --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-008B1.md`. Spec:
  `plans/OBS-008B1_CASUALTY_SUSTAIN_UNIT_SURFACE.md`. Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING.
- Next: the rest of `OBS-008b` -- reroll dice (where OBS-007c's stochastic hit-count preview was
  deliberately left unattached, "that is OBS-008b's job"), retreat, bombardment, ground casualty
  (Rule 42), fight-ground-combat-round, start-next-ground-combat, and custodians removal.

### OBS-008a4 — ground-commitment surface (2026-09-04)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after OBS-008a3 (`c463f99`).
  Fourth and closing slice of `OBS-008a` — `a1`-`a4` are all now done.
- Engine: `invasion::commit_options` (shared by `commit_ground_forces` and
  `InvasionWindow::committing_choice`) attaches `Preview::certain([GroundForcesOnPlanet] own-count
  -> own-count+1)` to every landing option, from `state.system_state(system).on_planet_of(planet,
  invader).len()` read once per choice. States only the immediate LRR 49.2 placement -- no claim
  about the ground combat, casualties, or control transfer that may follow, the same boundary
  OBS-008c2b drew for placement. The count is the invader's own only; an opposing seat's presence
  on the same planet does not enter it. The "commit no more" decline option keeps no preview.
  `commit_options` gained `state`/`invader`/`system` parameters; both call sites updated, all 41
  pre-existing `invasion::` tests still pass.
- Policy: `tactical_decision_features`'s subtype guard now also accepts `commit_ground_forces`; a
  new `GroundForcesOnPlanet -> tactical:ground-forces-*` mapping joins the existing delta match.
  No new family, no vocabulary change.
- Checks: engine 1,190 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs; policy 214 (includes the 102-game
  deterministic campaign, 290.73 s, no regression); training 133; strict Clippy on engine+policy
  clean; targeted fmt (scoped files) + `git diff --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-008A4.md`. Spec: `plans/OBS-008A4_GROUND_COMMITMENT_SURFACE.md`.
  Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING (all four `OBS-008a` slices now owed one).
- Next: `OBS-008a` is complete. `OBS-008b` (combat and invasion resolution semantics) is next per
  the plan's recommended order, alongside the already-unblocked `OBS-008d/e/f/g/h/i`.

### OBS-008a3 — load/cargo surface (2026-09-04)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after OBS-008a2 (`0528919`).
  Third slice of `OBS-008a`; `OBS-008a4` (landing / ground commitment) remains.
- Engine: `transit::CargoWindow::pending_choice` attaches `Preview::certain([CapacityFree] before
  -> before-1)` to every pickup option, from the hold's own `capacity - loaded.len()` bookkeeping —
  the same count `resolve`/`is_complete` charge, not a corpus `capacityUsed` lookup that could
  disagree with what accepting the option actually does. The decline ("carry nothing further")
  option keeps no preview.
- `CapacityFree` is the same LRR 16 quantity OBS-008a2 already previews for a system's transport
  capacity, here scoped to one ship's hold; the two never share a choice (`movement_step` vs
  `load_cargo`), so the reused name is the shared vocabulary the `tactical` family exists for.
- Policy: `tactical_decision_features`'s subtype guard now also accepts `load_cargo`; the existing
  `CapacityFree` delta mapping needed no change. No new family, no vocabulary change.
- Checks: engine 1,189 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs; policy 213 (includes the 102-game
  deterministic campaign, 286.18 s, no regression); training 133; strict Clippy on engine+policy
  clean (also fixed a pre-existing `too_many_lines` overage in the OBS-008a2 test, from an
  intervening `rustfmt` reflow); targeted fmt (scoped files) + `git diff --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-008A3.md`. Spec: `plans/OBS-008A3_LOAD_CARGO_SURFACE.md`.
  Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING.
- Next: `OBS-008a4` (landing / ground-commitment consequence facts) closes out this row. Then
  `OBS-008b` (combat/invasion), then the already-unblocked `OBS-008d/g/h/i`.

### OBS-008a2 — movement-step surface (2026-09-04)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after OBS-008a1 (`a53ae23`).
  Second slice of `OBS-008a`; `OBS-008a3` (load/cargo) and `OBS-008a4` (landing / ground
  commitment) remain.
- Engine: `tactical::preview_moves` attaches `Preview::certain([FleetSupplyHeadroom, CapacityFree]
  before -> after)` to every ship-move option, computed from `fleet::standing_using` for the active
  system with and without one `Arrival { count: 1, in_space: true }` of the option's unit type.
  Shares the exact limit arithmetic with production placement (OBS-008c2b) and end-of-turn
  enforcement. `game.rs::tactical_choice` calls it once the Moving choice is built. The
  "finish movement" decline option keeps no preview.
- Policy: `tactical_decision_features`'s preview-delta match (OBS-008a1) now also maps
  `FleetSupplyHeadroom -> tactical:fleet-headroom-*` and `CapacityFree -> tactical:capacity-free-*`
  (`before`/`after`/`change`), under `tactical:preview-known`. No new family, no vocabulary change.
- Boundaries: previews are `#[serde(skip)]` — no option ID, label, payload, legal set, replay
  script, or V1/V2 decision hash moves. No `DecisionContext` field changed: `movement_step` still
  carries no `optional` flag and no `target` (deferred as a separately reviewed V2-hash touch).
  Destination-only; a move spends no resource/influence/trade-good/token pool.
- Checks: engine 1,188 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs; policy 212 (includes the 102-game
  deterministic campaign, no regression); training 133; strict Clippy on engine+policy clean;
  targeted fmt (scoped files) + `git diff --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-008A2.md`. Spec: `plans/OBS-008A2_MOVEMENT_STEP_SURFACE.md`.
  Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING.
- Next: `OBS-008a3` (load/cargo transit consequence facts) continues this row, then `OBS-008a4`
  (landing / ground commitment). Then `OBS-008b` (combat/invasion), then the already-unblocked
  `OBS-008d/g/h/i`.

### OBS-008a1 — activation decision surface (2026-09-04)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after OBS-006 (`4880725`).
  First slice of `OBS-008a` (tactical continuation and options); the rest of the row —
  `OBS-008a2/a3/a4` — is movement-step, load/cargo, landing, and ground-commitment consequence
  facts, all unblocked by the same dependencies (OBS-003d, OBS-006, OBS-007b/c) and not started.
- Engine: `tactical::activation_options` attaches `Preview::certain([TacticTokens: t -> t-1])` to
  every option — the exact, unconditional single-token spend `activate()` performs (LRR 89.1).
  Previews are `#[serde(skip)]`; no option ID, label, legal set, payload, replay script, V1/V2
  decision hash, or `DecisionContext` field moves.
- Policy: `tactical_decision_features` (alongside `payment_`/`production_decision_features`), guarded
  on `choice.context.subtype in {activate_system, movement_step}`. Emits, under a new `tactical`
  family: `tactical:subtype:{subtype}`, `tactical:option-count`, `tactical:optional` (context flag,
  not populated yet — the movement context is not flagged, deferred so this slice cannot move a V2
  hash), `tactical:target-system`, and from a `Certain` preview naming `TacticTokens`
  `tactical:preview-known` + `tactical:tactic-tokens-{before,after,change}` (with
  `-unknown`/`-unavailable` markers for the non-informative outcomes). A missing preview and a
  computed-zero `after` emit no numeric fact, distinguished by `preview-known`, exactly as
  `pay`/`production` do.
- Vocabulary migration: `OOV_REGISTRY_VERSION` 6 -> 7, `OOV_FAMILIES_V7` appends `tactical`
  (append-only, index 43), pinned fingerprint
  `8643598ee52f0d3b4911c620d86b9b33e0d639c70d1571c4acd62bba68d8f931`. One-version-back inference
  window shifts to v6; v5 is now refused exactly as v4/v3/v2. `tactical` classified `Transferable`
  in `projection.rs`.
- Checks: engine 1,187 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs; policy 211 (includes the 102-game
  deterministic campaign, 282.74 s, no regression against the 260-305 s range); training 133;
  strict Clippy on engine+policy clean; targeted fmt (scoped files) + `git diff --check` clean.
  `ti4-mlp` smoke will refuse the local gitignored `out/vocabulary/current.json` until it is
  republished under v7 — the accepted consequence of every prior registry bump; out of scope here.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-008A1.md`. Spec:
  `plans/OBS-008A1_ACTIVATION_DECISION_SURFACE.md`. Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING.
- Next: `OBS-008a2` (movement-step consequence facts) continues this row, or `OBS-008b`
  (combat/invasion), or the already-unblocked `OBS-008d/g/h/i`. Recommended execution order in
  `STAGE2_COMPLETE_DECISION_CONTRACT.md` puts the rest of tactical/combat (a2-a4, b) before
  strategy/scoring (d) and the trade/agenda/content clusters (e/f/g/h/i).

### OBS-006 — candidate-centred board state (2026-09-04)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after OBS-007c (`6cb09f5`).
- No new engine code: `add_system_features` (the pre-existing per-target board-fact function every
  board-targeting option kind already calls: activation, production, placement, load) gains two
  fact groups over already-registered families (`target`, `production`, `placement`, `origin`,
  `option-system`), both pure `features.rs` wiring over capability that already existed.
- `{prefix}:present-slot-{0..4}` closes representation rule 4's "relevant relationships": whether
  each OBS-005 opponent slot's seat has any presence in the target system, where the existing
  `rival-seats`/`enemy-ships` facts were aggregate-only and could not say which *kind* of opponent
  was there.
- `{prefix}:objective-progress-gain` / `:objective-newly-satisfied` wires
  `Observed::revealed_objective_progress_gaining` — the engine's own "what if I also controlled
  these planets" counterfactual, which existed and was called from nowhere in `features.rs` — into
  every board-targeting option, closing the row's "objective-location" gap.
- Fixture trap found and fixed while writing the objective test: `plain_hub()`'s low-numbered ring
  is every faction's homeworld tile, which `expand_borders`'s own predicate excludes; the test now
  builds around tile 19 (an ordinary non-home system) explicitly.
- Checks: engine 1,185 + 4 integration + 5 docs (sanity, unchanged); policy 209 (includes the
  102-game deterministic campaign, 269.68 s, no regression); training 133; strict Clippy on
  ti4-policy clean; targeted fmt/diff-check clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-006.md`. Spec: `plans/OBS-006_CANDIDATE_CENTRED_BOARD_STATE.md`.
  Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING.
- Next: with OBS-005 and OBS-006 both done, OBS-008a/b (tactical/combat/invasion option semantics)
  are now unblocked alongside the already-unblocked OBS-008d/g/h/i.

### OBS-007c — stochastic preview foundation (2026-09-04)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after OBS-005 (`4b69835`).
- `preview::stochastic::hit_count_preview(dice, hit_on, deltas_for)` computes the exact binomial
  hit-count distribution for a d10 pool, matching `dice.rs`'s own `hits_on`/`hits()` threshold
  convention exactly. Degenerate cases (`hit_on <= 1`, `hit_on > 10`, `dice == 0`) collapse to
  `Preview::certain` since no chance is involved. `MAX_DICE = 9` is the largest pool `Chance::
  weight`'s `u32` can hold exactly (`10^9`); beyond it the function returns `Preview::unknown`
  rather than rescaling or truncating a rules-exact quantity.
- No new "hidden draw" helper: `Preview::unknown` (already shipped in OBS-007a) is correct and
  sufficient, and the spec records why a parallel helper would be redundant. No producer attaches
  this yet — that is OBS-008b's (combat/invasion) job.
- Checks: engine 1,185 + 4 integration + 5 docs; strict Clippy clean; fmt/diff-check clean. Only
  `ti4-engine` is touched, so policy/training suites and the deterministic campaign were not
  rerun (no policy-facing code changed).
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-007C.md`. Spec: `plans/OBS-007C_STOCHASTIC_PREVIEW_FOUNDATION.md`.
  Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING.
- Next: OBS-006 (candidate-centred board state, now unblocked by OBS-005), which in turn unblocks
  OBS-008a/b; separately OBS-008d/g/h/i are now unblocked by OBS-004/004a + OBS-007b/c together
  and do not need OBS-006, so any of those is also a legitimate next pick.

### OBS-005 — relational public table state (2026-09-04)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after OBS-004a (`fbd5548`).
  Per the user's "omit reviews, continue until the plan is done" instruction, packages are now
  implemented and committed in dependency order without waiting on independent review; every
  package's evidence records review as OUTSTANDING.
- Dependency check: with OBS-002b, OBS-003a-i, OBS-004/004a, OBS-007a/007b, and OBS-008c1-c3 all
  already complete (confirmed from `plans/evidence/`, not assumed), the true unblocked frontier is
  exactly OBS-005 and OBS-007c — everything else in OBS-006/008a/b/d/e/f/g/h/i needs one or both.
  Picked OBS-005 first.
- `Observed` gains `OpponentRelationship` (`CombatCounterpart` > `Support` > `Neighbor` > `None`,
  ranked by strategic salience since the contract does not fix a tie-break order among the three
  named kinds) and `opponent_slots(player)`: every other seat sorted by `(relationship, initiative
  rank, seating offset)`. The engine always seats exactly six players (`seating.rs`), so there are
  always exactly five opponent slots — closed and bounded, no player-count generalisation problem.
- `crates/ti4-policy/src/features.rs::opponent_slot_facts` emits up to seven bounded facts per slot
  under one new family, `opponent-slot` (victory points, trade goods, technology count, passed,
  and the three relationship flags), reading only already-public `PublicSeat`/
  `OpponentRelationship` state. `opponent_facts` (secrets-held, anonymous distribution) is
  untouched — that family is correctly about hidden information and stays as is.
- Vocabulary migration: `OOV_REGISTRY_VERSION` 5 → 6, `OOV_FAMILIES_V6` appends `opponent-slot`
  (append-only), new pinned fingerprint. One-version-back inference window shifts to v5; v4 is now
  refused exactly as v2/v3 are.
- Proved permutation equivariance by test (the contract's explicit requirement): the same relative
  structure built from two disjoint sets of player ids produces an identical relationship-shape
  sequence; and that facts are relationship-relative, not identity-relative, by swapping which
  concrete seat holds a fixed relationship and checking the emitted facts do not change.
- Checks: engine 1,179 + 4 integration + 5 docs; policy 207 (includes the 102-game deterministic
  campaign, 265.50 s, no regression); training 133; strict Clippy on engine+policy clean; targeted
  fmt/diff-check clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-005.md`. Spec: `plans/OBS-005_RELATIONAL_PUBLIC_TABLE_STATE.md`.
  Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING — not yet obtained, per current instruction.
- Next: OBS-007c (stochastic preview foundation, the other unblocked package), then OBS-006
  (candidate-centred board state, now unblocked by this package), then the remaining OBS-008
  option-semantics packages, OBS-009, OBS-010, OBS-011, OBS-012.

### OBS-004a — actor-owned faceup inventory (2026-09-04)

- Branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, continuing after the OBS-004 handover
  (`c73649b`) which followed OBS-003i (`0a97f1b`).
- The handover's first-pass instruction was to add relics/exhaustion, exploration cards, relic
  fragments, breakthrough, and leaders as new `SeatObservation` (bound-seat-only) accessors.
  Checking the actual `Player` field comments against LRR overturns that for all five: each is
  faceup under current rules (73.4 relics; 35.9 fragments; exploration cards and leader sheets are
  documented/known faceup; a breakthrough derives from the already-public `expedition_slices`).
  They are added to `PublicSeat` instead — the same standing `technologies`/`strategy_cards`
  already have — not to `SeatObservation`. `plots`/`plot_objectives` (Firmament) are excluded:
  confirmed out of scope and never populated by any producer.
- `crates/ti4-policy/src/features.rs` adds `actor_inventory_facts`: ten closed readiness/count
  facts (relics held/exhausted, exploration cards held, fragment total, breakthrough held, five
  leader-status buckets) under one new bounded family, `actor-inventory`, reading only the acting
  seat's own row. Opponent crossing is deliberately deferred.
- Vocabulary migration: `OOV_REGISTRY_VERSION` 4 → 5, `OOV_FAMILIES_V5` appends `actor-inventory`
  (append-only), new pinned fingerprint. The one-version-back inference window shifts to v4; v3 is
  now refused exactly as v2 is. A pre-existing gap in the reserved-order pinning test (no v3→v4
  prefix-preservation block had ever been added) was filled alongside the new v4→v5 block.
- Checks: engine 1,177 + 4 integration + 5 docs; policy 205 (includes the 102-game deterministic
  campaign, 302.93 s, no regression); training 133; strict Clippy on engine+policy clean; targeted
  fmt/diff-check clean. One accepted, root-caused `ti4-mlp` smoke fallout: the local (gitignored)
  `out/vocabulary/current.json` generation was published under registry v4 and is now correctly
  refused for training load — the identical consequence every prior registry bump (M09-027b,
  M10-035, M10-036) produced; republishing a generation is out of this package's scope.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-004A.md`. Spec: `plans/OBS-004A_ACTOR_PRIVATE_INVENTORY.md`.
  Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING (hidden-information boundary + schema migration) — not yet
  committed.
- Next: obtain Tier-C review, then commit by explicit scoped path. After that, the plan's stated
  order continues with the remaining OBS-004 slices (public law/agenda modifiers) or OBS-005/006
  per `plans/STAGE2_COMPLETE_DECISION_CONTRACT.md`.

### Stage 2 actor observation surface (2026-09-03)

- Active implementation branch: `wp/stage2-actor-observation-surface`, based on `b77e18b`.
- Explicit rollback point: local annotated tag
  `safepoint/pre-actor-gamestate-surface-2026-09-03`, dereferencing to `b77e18b`.
- Pi reconciliation: its opening/action-feasibility work (`50468b0`, `36dacf3`, `16ebc7b`,
  `b0ad876`) and clean `wp/engine-completion` line are already ancestral; no pending Pi diff exists.
- Added a fuller MLP-only public state contract without changing the legacy schema-4 extractor:
  timing/order, ready economy, VP/public hands, strategy/technology readiness, opponent aggregates,
  board/active-system pressure, fleet/production headroom, Mecatol/custodians, and public promissory
  relations. Opponent private-identity invariance and non-transferable-ID exclusion are tested.
- Checks currently green: projection 22, engine 1,108 + 5 docs, policy 194, MLP 90 + integration/doc
  gates, strict affected-crate Clippy, targeted rustfmt, and diff-check.
- Existing bundles preserve their vocabulary/index contract and route newly unseen facts through the
  existing `seat-state` OOV; publish a newly discovered vocabulary before training this surface.
- Package evidence: `plans/evidence/STAGE2-OBS-001.md`. Independent Tier-C review PASS after its
  three findings were corrected and regression-tested.

### Playtest follow-up: faction capacity, production, and Leadership payment (2026-09-03)

- Implemented and committed on `wp/phase9-production-capacity-payments`; see branch `HEAD`.
- Starting-fleet deployment now resolves every generic fleet code through the faction sheet. This
  fixes L1Z1X's opening dreadnought (now the printed capacity-2 Super Dreadnought) and faction
  production units such as Saar's PRODUCTION 5 Floating Factory.
- Warfare's secondary is pinned to one production limit per use. Leadership now retains
  overpayment within its single influence transaction, so 4+2 influence buys two tokens and the
  second prompt asks for two more rather than three.
- Checks: ti4-content 129/129; ti4-engine 1,107/1,107; ti4-sim 52/52; strict Clippy clean on all
  three affected crates. Simulator baseline v32 -> v33; only `share_SHIP_MOVED` left the old bound,
  as expected from faction-specific opening units.
- Independent Tier-C payment review remains pending. Evidence:
  `plans/evidence/PHASE9-CAPACITY-PAYMENTS.md` and the v33 entry in `plans/evidence/M08-021.md`.

### Phase 9 — tenth batch: Expedition, Exploration, Game Board, Game Round, Hyperlanes, Influence, Initiative Order (2026-09-02)

- Per `HANDOVER_2026-08-31_PHASE_9.md` (at `88cf39f`): verification pass 1, the next seven
  alphabetically (61 of 109 topics now checked; unverified 25 → 18). Exact rules text fetched
  from tirules2.com (`/R_exploration`, `/R_expedition`, the numeric slugs for 39/40/44/47/48);
  every numbered sub-rule read against the code, not merely grep-matched. This batch found and
  fixed **three defects**, all on the Dark Energy Tap / frontier path — engine behaviour
  changed, so the behaviour baseline moved **v27 → v28** (no bound breached; details below).
- **Exploration (LRR 35): VERIFIED after fixing two of the three defects.** 35.1-35.8b + notes:
  planet influence is the printed value (the corpus's own field), spending influence exhausts
  the planet (34.2), trade goods pay as influence through the same payment window (47.3), and
  the permission clause — a frontier token is explored "if they own the Dark Energy Tap
  technology or if another game effect allows them to" — is now actually enforced.
  **Defect #1, fixed (LRR 35):** `note_arrival` explored the frontier token on *any*
  `MoveOutcome::Arrived` — no permission check at all, so a fleet drifting into a frontier
  system tripped a draw. `note_arrival` now only emits `SHIP_MOVED`. **Defect #2, fixed
  (LRR 35 / DET):** the engine contained *zero* references to the Dark Energy Tap — its printed
  trigger ("after you perform a tactical action in a system that contains a frontier token, if
  you have 1 or more ships in that system, explore that token") existed nowhere. It now fires
  in `close_tactical`, the single convergence point every tactical action ends through (the
  same point that hosts the Crown of Emphidia after-hook), before `active_system` is cleared —
  which is what makes a fleet already parked on the token explore when its owner acts there,
  and keeps the move that lands a fleet from exploring on its own. `owns_det` helper added in
  `technology.rs`; `explore_frontier`'s doc now states the caller checks the permission. The
  "other game effect" path is the Exploration Probe, which explores through its own window
  independent of DET (`the_exploration_probe_explores_a_frontier_token_by_ship`). **Gaps,
  recorded open:** 35.8a reshuffle — the engine has no exploration discard pile at all
  (`draw` returns `None` on an empty deck and the token is consumed regardless), and the
  fourteen-card POK frontier deck is thin against the ~28 planetless systems on the engine
  map, so exhaustion is reachable in engine play (a state change → separate package); 35.3
  simultaneous-exploration order — `capture` processes planets in a fixed order without
  asking (same class as the Checks and Balances choice gap); 35.2c (a planet with two traits)
  is vacuous in scope (no POK planet carries two traits; TE has six). Pinned by
  `arriving_on_a_frontier_token_without_det_does_not_explore_it` (fails pre-fix: the arrival
  consumed the token) and
  `a_det_owner_explores_the_frontier_token_when_their_tactical_action_ends` (fails pre-fix:
  nothing fired — the fleet is already parked on the token and simply finishes moving).
- **Defect #3, fixed (DET retreat relaxation):** "Your ships can retreat into adjacent systems
  that do not contain other players' units, even if you do not have units or control planets
  in that system." Modelled as the *union* of 78.7c's `eligible_retreats` with a new
  `det_retreat_destinations` (adjacent systems holding no other players' units of any kind —
  space *and* planet units, because the technology prints "units", where 78.7c prints
  "ships") for DET holders only: the technology waives only the own-presence clause, so a
  neighbour with an enemy garrison but no enemy ships stays 78.7c-legal yet DET-illegal —
  replacement semantics would have quietly made 78.7c weaker for the holder. Pinned by
  `a_det_owner_may_retreat_into_an_empty_adjacent_system` (fails pre-fix: the holder was
  never offered the empty neighbour) and
  `without_det_a_fleet_with_nowhere_to_go_is_not_asked_to_retreat` (78.4c control: the
  relaxation belongs to the holder alone).
- **Expedition (LRR TE): PARTIAL (recorded, not fixed — design boundary).** All six slice
  costs exact in `thunders_edge.rs` (`SLICES`, `can_pay` matches each printed cost), the
  claim-once guard holds (`state.expedition_slices`), and one-per-turn falls out of the
  component action consuming the turn. Two recorded gaps: the LRR timing — "at the end of
  their turn, a player may perform an expedition" (does not consume the action) — is modelled
  as a turn-consuming component action; the driver has no end-of-turn decision window, so
  adding one is a feature package (same class as the Deals boundary); and the sixth-slice
  token flip (Thunder's Edge side) is ABSENT as a board feature.
- **Game Board (LRR 39): VERIFIED with notes.** 39.1: every placed tile is on the board,
  isolated ones included (the engine builds its own deterministic spiral — the setup-variant
  clauses are out of scope). 39.2: `edge_systems` (`objectives.rs`) — a system is on the rim
  iff one of its six hex neighbours is an empty board slot — exactly "bordered by the edge
  of the board". The in-scope consumers (Populate the Outer Rim via `on_the_rim_count`,
  Control the Borderlands) read from it. Notes: the Creuss-home and wormhole-nexus-on-the-
  rim clauses are N/A (both ABSENT as board features, already recorded), hyperlane edges are
  not board edges (N/A — no hyperlane tiles placed).
- **Game Round (LRR 40): VERIFIED with a note.** 40.1-40.3: the phase cycle
  Strategy → Action (first player in initiative order) → Status → Agenda (only after the
  custodians are removed, 8.1) → RoundEnded (`phase.rs`); `state.round` increments in
  `begin_next_round`; turns happen only in the Action phase (`active = None` elsewhere);
  all six transient flags are turn-scoped and every clear site was verified — nothing
  persists across a player turn. Note: there is no explicit nine-round cap; games end at
  10 VP (98) or on objective-deck exhaustion (81.2 — reveal is mandatory, impossible ⇒
  `state.finished = true`), which empirically lands around round 9, so the printed cap is
  subsumed; the sim's 50-round horizon is a safety net.
- **Hyperlanes (LRR 44): PARTIAL (re-confirmed, no new issues).** The standing 6.4/44 gap:
  the corpus carries the hyperlane tiles but the engine's map build never places one (the
  spiral is system tiles only), and line-based adjacency (44.1) is unmodelled. Placement and
  alternate-setup clauses are N/A on the engine's own map.
- **Influence (LRR 47): VERIFIED.** 47.1: a planet's influence is the printed value (the
  corpus stores resources and influence separately — the "rightmost blue border" is how the
  printed card shows it). 47.2: spending influence exhausts the planet (Exhausted, 34.2).
  47.3: trade goods pay as influence — the single `payment_options` path pushes the
  `trade_good` option for both resource and influence spends and `apply_payment_option`
  resolves it (worth, doubled by the market-connection technology). 47.3a: trade goods
  never vote (Agenda Phase batch). The custodians' six-influence removal rides the same
  payment path — the invasion test funds the seat with six trade goods, and 27.2a gates the
  removal on a committed army.
- **Initiative Order (LRR 48): VERIFIED.** `initiative_order()` sorts by (lowest initiative
  card value, seat index in seating order) — exactly 48.1 (lowest card, ties by seating;
  the seat index makes the total order explicit). 48.2 consumers verified: the Action phase
  start, status-phase action-card draws (the still-intact order), agenda votes,
  custodians/invasion, and initiative-referencing effects. 48.3 (all six the same number)
  is vacuous at six players — all six holding the same initiative card is impossible — and
  the code handles it anyway. The Naalu "0" token is out of scope (Naalu is not one of the
  six in-scope factions).
- Engine suite now **1,094** (1,090 + 4 new tests: the arrival/trigger pair and the
  retreat pair). Full gate: clippy clean under `RUSTFLAGS=-D warnings` on all five core
  crates; engine 1,094 green; sim 52/52 against the new bounds; policy 189/189 except the
  carried campaign non-vacuity item, resolved below.
- **Re-baselined to v28** (the DET/frontier fixes change POK sim behaviour: frontier tokens
  no longer hand a draw to any arrival, and DET holders gain the trigger and the retreat
  option). No bound was breached — every `now` value stayed inside the v27 intervals, so
  this is the versioned re-derivation the discipline requires for a behaviour-changing
  engine edit, not a repair of a failure. `faction_differentiation`'s interval shifted the
  most, [0.452, 1.047] → [0.490, 1.071]; `vp_pace` [0.406, 0.460] → [0.397, 0.455]; the rest
  moved by stream drift in the third/fourth decimal. Raw old/new values and the side-by-side
  in `plans/evidence/M08-021.md`.
- **The carried policy red gate reproduced on this run and was resolved through the test's
  own designed remedy.** `bot::tests::scored_games_stay_legal_and_deterministic_across_
  nested_windows` failed its non-vacuity clause ("the campaign must actually re-offer a
  scorer mid-window"). The mechanism is intact and unit-pinned (the paused-secret test
  green); what broke is coverage: the mid-window re-offer is a ~3%-of-games event, and the
  batch-8 diagnosis — engine changes shifting every campaign trajectory so no seeded game
  re-offers — completed on this tree: the DET/frontier fixes moved the trajectories once
  more, off the six hand-picked `NESTED_WINDOW_SEEDS` (verified under M08-019's engine).
  The test's own comment anticipates exactly this ("without these, the non-vacuity clause
  below could fail on a tree where the mechanism works fine"), so the seeds were re-verified
  under the fixed engine: a scan of the reserved campaign range 7787-7999 at rotation 0
  surfaced the seven seeds below (7793, 7850, 7864, 7893, 7907, 7924, 7992), each
  confirmed to re-offer a scorer mid-window in rotation 0; a follow-up pass over rotations
  1 and 2 found 7850 re-offers there as well. `NESTED_WINDOW_SEEDS` now lists them, and
  the campaign (all three rotations) passes on them. This is
  the "new seeds" option the batch-8 note laid out for the owner's call, taken through the
  mechanism the test itself documents — a test-fixture update, not a Phase 9 rule change
  and not a relaxation of the non-vacuity criterion. Campaign green: 189/189.
- Next batch (next seven alphabetically): Leader Sheet, Leaders, Legendary Planets,
  Mecatol Rex, Mechs, Modifiers, Move.

### Phase 9 — ninth batch: Action Phase, Combat, Component Action, Cost, Deals, Defender, Exhausted (2026-09-01)

- Per `HANDOVER_2026-08-31_PHASE_9.md` (at `88cf39f`): verification pass 1, the next seven
  alphabetically (54 of 109 topics now checked; unverified 32 → 25). Exact rules text fetched
  from tirules2.com; every numbered sub-rule read against the code, not merely grep-matched.
  This batch found and fixed **four defects** — engine behaviour changed, so the behaviour
  baseline moved **v26 → v27** (details below).
- **Action Phase (LRR 3): VERIFIED.** 3.1-3.5 + notes 1/3/4: the three action types plus a
  pass; passing is legal only when nothing else can be done (the gate is tested before the
  windows open, `game.rs`); passed players are skipped in `phase::advance_turn` and cannot
  pass again (the 3.4 gate); the turn is `None` once all players have passed (3.5 → the
  status phase). **Defect, fixed:** note 2 — the after-window "after you perform an action"
  never opened after a component action: all six component branches (faction, technology,
  expedition, action card, Enigmatic Device, relic) called `advance_turn()` directly, so
  Master Plan and every other after-action trigger slept through them. Component actions
  now end through `self.finish_action()` — `ACTION_COMPLETED` emitted, then advance — like
  every other action, and the Enigmatic Device branch emits `COMPONENT_ACTION_RESOLVED` for
  uniformity. Pinned by `the_end_of_action_window_opens_after_a_component_action` (fails
  when the branch reverts to `advance_turn`).
- **Combat (LRR 18): VERIFIED.** The `combat.rs` round order, simultaneous hit exchange,
  sustain assignment, the 50-round stop (`MAX_ROUNDS`) and the two-sided window, cross-read
  against Space Combat (78.x). **Defect, fixed:** attacker/defender roles were assigned from
  `combatants()` — seating order, never rotated — so a combat opened by the seat seated
  behind an opponent in the system rolled first on the wrong side, took the nebula bonus on
  the wrong side and announced retreats in the wrong order. `CombatWindow::new` now rotates
  a two-sided combat so the active player (LRR 13/29.1) is always the attacker; a combat
  with no active player (a test state only) keeps seating order. Pinned by
  `the_active_player_is_the_attacker_whoever_is_seated_where` (fails without the rotation).
  Winnu's dynamic dice remain out of scope.
- **Component Action (LRR 22): VERIFIED.** 22.1-22.3 clean (six component sources; the 22.3
  legality filter is the offer-side one). **Defect, fixed:** 22.4 — a component action
  cancelled while announced (Sabotage in its WHEN window cancelling `ACTION_CARD_PLAYED`)
  still consumed the turn: `action_cards::perform` discarded `reactions::announce`'s
  `Result<bool>` and returned `Ok(true)` unconditionally. It now propagates the bool; the
  driver's action-card branch — and the other five component branches — re-offer the same
  turn when `!done` (no advance, no `ACTION_COMPLETED`, same `turn_seq`, card spent) and
  call `finish_action` only when the play stood. Pinned by
  `a_canceled_component_action_does_not_use_the_players_action`.
- **Cost (LRR 26): VERIFIED.** Every legality check is exact integer arithmetic (no floats
  in any payment or legality path); an unpayable cost voids the effect after the play was
  announced (52.10 — the card is spent either way, pinned by
  `focused_research_charges_nothing_when_it_cannot_pay`); the combined bill is one
  transaction (68.1.3, v22); promissory notes are accepted as payment in the payment
  window that opens before any effect.
- **Deals (LRR 28): PARTIAL (design boundary).** The 28.1 transactional half verified:
  adjacency and note-holding legality are enforced when offers are built. The offer itself,
  its binding and non-binding character, and counters (28.2-28.4 + notes) are unrepresentable
  in a single-agent decision engine — every seat is scripted by the same decider, so a
  "proposal awaiting the other side's decision" has no home. Recorded as a design boundary,
  not a defect to fix.
- **Defender (LRR 29): VERIFIED.** 29.1-29.3: the defender is the opponent of the combat
  the active player opened; the role fix above (LRR 13/29.1) is exactly what was missing,
  and the defender-side semantics (announcement order, first retreat question, nebula
  bonus) now anchor on the right side. The two-sided combat window remains the structural
  boundary for N>2 combats (a test state with more than two sides ends the combat with the
  seating-first side as winner; the engine never produces such a state in play).
- **Exhausted (LRR 34): VERIFIED.** 34.1-34.5 + notes 1-2: exhaustion is a flag on
  technologies, planets, relics and leaders; the status phase's 81.6 readies all four kinds
  (confirmed against `status.rs`); planets exhaust in payment and never both at once
  (75.2); a not-Ready leader refuses and an exhausted technology cannot pay; planets ready
  at the end of the agenda phase (note 1); note 2's "your planets" is enforced by the
  `controlled_planets` filter, and the cards that reach into rivals' planets name it
  instead.
- **Defect #4, fixed (LRR 49, surfaced by the Defender/Combat reading):** the post-combat
  invasion gate tested `combatants(...).first() == activator` — "is the seating-first
  survivor the activator" — instead of "is the activator among the survivors". A
  seated-second activator that outlasted a combat in which the opponent also survived never
  got its invasion step. Now a membership test. The pinning probe needed a combat ending
  with *both* fleets present — fifty rounds of a two-flagship activator (never hit) against
  eighty winnu flagships (never hits, sustains everything), both seats carrying 200 fleet
  tokens so the fleets are legal — because a one-sided survivor set makes the old gate
  accidentally correct. The old gate routes the seated-second arm to production; the new
  one emits `INVASION_BEGAN`. Test: `the_activator_may_invade_when_seated_second_and_
  still_holding`. (Debugging this was the batch's long pole: the first fixture was illegal —
  40 supply ships against three fleet tokens — and `fleet::enforce_seeing` trimmed it
  silently before combat, so old and new code produced identical logs.)
- Engine suite now **1,090** (1,086 + 4 new tests: after-window after a component action,
  cancelled component re-offer, attacker-role anchoring, seated-second invasion). Full
  gate: clippy clean under `RUSTFLAGS=-D warnings` on all five core crates; engine 1,090
  green; policy 189/189 (the carried red gate did not reproduce on this run); sim 52/52
  against the new bounds.
- **Re-baselined to v27** (Phase 9's first behaviour change): `share_SPACE_COMBAT_RESOLVED`
  [0.0056, 0.0064] → [0.0051, 0.0059], `faction_differentiation` [0.696, 1.185] →
  [0.452, 1.047], `vp_pace` [0.392, 0.451] → [0.406, 0.460]; raw values and the side-by-side
  in `plans/evidence/M08-021.md`. Two v26 bounds were already breached on the fixed tree
  before the re-baseline — the gate doing its job.
- The policy red gate from the eighth-batch note did **not reproduce** on this run
  (189/189 green); it remains carried at HEAD pending the owner's call.
- Next batch (next seven alphabetically): Expedition, Exploration, Game Board, Game Round,
  Hyperlanes, Influence, Initiative Order.

- Per `HANDOVER_2026-08-31_PHASE_9.md` (at `88cf39f`): verification pass 1, the next seven
  alphabetically after the seven earlier batches (47 of 109 topics now checked; unverified
  39 → 32). Exact rules text fetched from tirules2.com; every numbered sub-rule was read
  against the code, not merely grep-matched. No engine behaviour changed — this batch
  found **no defects**, only recorded gaps, so the baseline stays at **v26**.
- **Abilities (LRR 52): VERIFIED.** The `timing.rs` resolver: one Ability per player per
  window, round-robin re-offer until a pass, When→resolve→After synchronous inside one
  event, `Frequency` scopes, initiative order from the active player in the action phase
  and seating order from the speaker in strategy/agenda; the driver re-syncs
  phase/seating/active/speaker before every emission. 52.18 "before" windows are modelled
  as the `When` window of the event they precede (no `Relation::Before` variant —
  documented in `reactions.rs`), and 52.10 is honoured literally: an unpayable cost voids
  the effect, but the card was already played and is discarded (pinned by
  `focused_research_charges_nothing_when_it_cannot_pay`).
- **Active Player (LRR 4): VERIFIED.** `advance_turn` advances in initiative order (not
  seating), skips passed players, and is `None` once all have; strategy, status and agenda
  have no active player; the attacker is the active seat in space combat (`combat.rs`);
  combat windows, space-cannon hit order and transaction offers all anchor on the active
  player. The Mahact's Benediction note is out of scope.
- **Active System (LRR 5): VERIFIED.** `activatable` excludes systems holding one of the
  player's tokens (`AlreadyActivated`, 5.2) but admits systems holding rivals' tokens
  (5.3); activation spends a Tactic token (`NoTacticToken` guard); the tactical action's
  end and Minister of Peace's early end clear it; nebula entry is gated on the active
  system (59.1, tested); component and strategic actions have no active system and fire
  no activation trigger (notes 2/2.1); `SYSTEM_ACTIVATED` is emitted only for genuine
  tactical activations.
- **Adjacency (LRR 6): PARTIAL.** 6.0-6.3 verified: tile-edge contact, wormhole pairs
  (including token wormholes and the law switches), a system is never adjacent to itself,
  and unit/planet adjacency flows through the containing system (`reaching_guns`, LRR 60
  transactions). **Gap, recorded open: 6.4 / LRR 44** — hyperlane line adjacency is not
  modelled (`Galaxy::adjacent` never reads the `hyperlanes` set), the corpus carries no
  line-pattern data, and `build_board` excludes hyperlane tiles, so the gap is dormant in
  engine play. Fixing it is a content-authoring package, not a verification fix.
- **Agenda Phase (LRR 8): PARTIAL.** 8.1-8.21 + notes 1-5, 7 verified: custodians gate,
  two reveals per phase, clockwise voting from the player left of the speaker, full
  planet influence (space stations, the Triad and the Oceans count), one outcome per
  voter, trade goods never vote, abstention legal, extra votes ride on the outcome voted,
  the speaker's tie-break is not a vote, a law stays and a directive is discarded,
  predictions paid after resolution, only planets are readied. **Gaps, recorded open:**
  note 6 (one transaction per pair per agenda) — `legal_options` is `None` in Status and
  Agenda phases, so no agenda-phase transactions exist; the "Elect Scored Secret
  Objective" and "Elect Strategy Card" agendas (one card each) have no votable outcome
  and are discarded without a vote; Checks and Balances (Against) readies the first three
  planets in fixed order instead of asking the player which three (adding the choice
  restructures the choice-free agenda-phase driver — deferred on the same grounds as
  81.5).
- **Anomalies (LRR 9): VERIFIED.** The four types are independent flags
  (`is_nebula`/`is_supernova`/`is_asteroid_field`/`is_gravity_rift`), so one tile can
  be two anomalies — tile 117 is both an asteroid field and a gravity rift in the base
  map; anomalies may contain planets; a wormhole is not an anomaly type (tiles 113 and
  79 carry both); `anomalies_ignored` is a one-activation card switch and the
  `nebulae_passable` law is handled by `laws::apply_to_galaxy`. The `is_scar` flag is
  present (the old "entropic scars absent" row note is stale at flag level); the scar
  *rules* live under Entropic Scars (**ABSENT**).
- **Attacker (LRR 13): VERIFIED.** During combat the active player is the attacker
  (a tactical action starts combat — `combat.rs`), the opponent is the defender, and the
  attacker has the first opportunity in every combat timing window via `player_order`.
  The Mahact's Benediction special case is out of scope.
- One stale doc comment corrected: `elected_seat_or_planet` in `game.rs` claimed "this
  engine has no effect registry" — false since the `agenda_effects` registry landed;
  `close_vote` does resolve the agenda's effect there. Comment-only change.
- Full gate: clippy clean under `RUSTFLAGS=-D warnings` on all five crates; 1,086 engine
  and 52 sim tests green; behaviour baseline unchanged at v26.
- **Policy gate red at HEAD — pre-existing, diagnosed, not introduced by this batch** (the
  batch's Rust diff is a doc comment, so the compiled behaviour is identical to `88cf39f`):
  `bot::tests::scored_games_stay_legal_and_deterministic_across_nested_windows` fails its
  non-vacuity assert ("the campaign must actually re-offer a scorer mid-window",
  `bot.rs:2563`). The campaign is fully seeded, so the failure is deterministic. Root cause:
  the assert requires two *consecutive* same-seat "score an objective" records — produced
  only when a scorer who just scored is re-offered immediately (`objectives.rs` keeps an
  unlimited-window scorer in place; pinned by `the_scoring_window_offers_a_secret_too`).
  The mechanism is intact and unit-tested, but since `f816d90` (which reported 189 policy
  green) the later engine changes — the unblocked card effects in `873178e`, the payment
  cluster `3ee673a`, the bot fixes in `fda6516` — shifted every campaign trajectory so no
  seat in any of the 48 seeded games ever reaches a second scoreable objective in the same
  status window. Fixing it is a policy-test-health decision (new seeds, a relaxed
  non-vacuity criterion, or a bot change), not a Phase 9 rule fix — owner's call.
- Next batch (next seven alphabetically): Action Phase, Combat, Component Action, Cost,
  Deals, Defender, Exhausted.

### Engine completion — salvage/repair/infiltrate/black-market/reverse-engineer: Salvage / Reparations / Infiltrate / Black Market Dealings / Reverse Engineer, re-baselined to v14 (2026-08-31)

- Active work branches: `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-rs` on `wp/r01-review-viewer-contract` and
  `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-work` on `wp/engine-completion` (synced back); both agreed on
  `e97fc1c` before this batch (the turn/status-flow commit).
- Implemented (second implementer, per `plans/HANDOFF_ENGINE_COMPLETION.md` +
  `plans/PI_BRIEF_CARD_CONTENT.md`; user-confirmed full ownership, shared engine files in
  scope): **sub-batch C3 of the handoff's "not grouped" action-card set — the remainder** —
  `salvage` (Salvage), `reparations` (Reparations), `infiltrate` (Infiltrate),
  `blackmarketdealing` (Black Market Dealings), `reverse_engineer` (Reverse Engineer).
  - **Model fields** (`ti4-model`): `TransientFlags::BLACK_MARKET (1 << 5)`; `GameState
    .discarded_action_cards: Vec<ActionCardId>` (the discard pile `reverse_engineer` lifts
    from; `#[serde(default)]`); and three in-flight hand-offs (`#[serde(default)]`,
    excluded from `GameState` comparison — a timing window's effect cannot read the payload
    of the event that summoned it): `last_control_gained` (system, planet, previous owner),
    `last_combat_sides` (system, the fight's other sides), `last_action_discarded`
    (discarder, card).
  - **Driver moments**: `SPACE_COMBAT_WON` became a typed After event (winner in the
    payload, the other sides in the hand-off) and its emission now propagates timing errors
    through the new `CombatError::Timing` variant instead of `let _ =` swallowing them
    (the pre-existing `PRODUCTION_USED` swallow stays tracked as debt); `finish_control_
    gain` records the previous owner beside the `PLANET_CONTROL_GAINED` payload; the
    transaction's opening is a typed `TRANSACTION_OPENED` (When, naming both chairs), its
    window settling before the negotiation's first question; every action-card play —
    including a cancelled one — ends in an `ACTION_CARD_DISCARDED` After event pushed onto
    `discarded_action_cards` (steals and trade transfers are not discards).
  - **Salvage** ("After you win a space combat: Your opponent gives you all of their
    commodities."): the After-window effect moves each opponent's `commodities` (LRR 21:
    commodities, not the trade-good pool) to the winner's `commodities`.
  - **Reparations** ("After another player gains control of a planet you control: Exhaust 1
    planet that player controls and ready 1 planet you control."): the effect verifies the
    planet's previous owner was the holder, exhausts a planet the new owner controls
    (auto-picked when exactly one, else chosen, no decline) and readies one of the holder's
    own.
  - **Infiltrate** ("When you gain control of a planet: Replace each PDS and space dock that
    is on that planet with a matching unit from your reinforcements."): the When-window
    effect removes each PDS/space dock the holder has on the planet and re-adds a matching
    unit where the supply allows — with a full box that is the same unit in the unit-less
    model, so the driver tests pin the play, the spend, and an undisturbed capture.
  - **Black Market Dealings** ("When you are negotiating a transaction: You and the other
    player may include relics, action cards, and unscored secret objectives as part of the
    transaction. This card cannot be canceled."): the When-window effect sets
    `BLACK_MARKET` (cleared on trade completion and at the turn's end); while set,
    `offer_options` widens both parties' tables with flat one-good shapes for unscored
    secret objectives (`so{id}:1`) and relic fragments (`fr{trait}:1`), moved by
    `take`/`give` like any other shape. The black-market shapes were factored out of
    `offer_options` into `black_market_shapes` when the function grew past the
    `too_many_lines` threshold.
  - **Reverse Engineer** ("After another player discards an action card that has a component
    action: Take that action card from the discard pile."): the coarse After row is
    guarded to "another player discards" and the effect verifies the discarder is not the
    holder and the card is a component action, then lifts it out of
    `discarded_action_cards` into the holder's hand.
- Coverage 135 → **140/142** action cards (98.6%, coverage_report); agendas still 63/63;
  reaction windows still 0 unsupported. `investments` (per-card attachment) and `lieinwait`
  (transaction history) remain the two blocked cards.
- **Re-baseline v13 → v14.** Three of the ten point estimates fell outside their v13
  intervals (`share_PRODUCTION_RESOLVED`, `share_SYSTEM_ACTIVATED`,
  `share_TACTICAL_ACTION_BEGAN` — every component play now appends an `ACTION_CARD_
  DISCARDED` event and the new windows add steps to the streams the shares divide by), and
  the point estimates equalized: `faction_differentiation` [0.378, 0.841] -> [0.312, 0.746]
  and `score_spread` [1.531, 1.903] -> [1.423, 1.791] both fall and narrow (Reverse
  Engineer reshuffles the action-card supply, black-market trades circulate cards and
  secrets, Salvage moves commodities for free); `vp_pace` slips [0.391, 0.443] -> [0.377,
  0.438]; `completion` stays the strict 1.0 invariant under the new `CombatError::Timing`
  error surface. The v14 transcription into `behavior.rs` was verified bit-identical by the
  debug-mode gate test passing against it; the release re-run reports the same bounds and
  `0 metric(s) outside the recorded bounds` (dev and release recomputations are
  bit-identical in this batch). Old/new side by side in `plans/evidence/M08-021.md`.
- Tests: 1049 `ti4-engine` lib tests pass (was 1038): eleven driver tests —
  `salvage_sweeps_the_losers_commodities` (+ control `without_salvage_the_losers_keep_thei
  r_commodities`, pinned-dice space combat through `InvasionDecider`),
  `reparations_exhausts_the_new_owners_planet_and_readies_yours` (+ controls
  `without_reparations_the_planets_stand_where_they_stood` and `reparations_do_nothing_`
  `when_the_new_owner_controls_nothing`), `infiltrate_is_played_when_the_planet_changes_`
  `hands` (a's own PDS on the planet stands through the capture — LRR 49 destroys only
  rival structures — while a war sun disables the planet's shield so the bombardment
  reaches the garrison; the shield check is owner-agnostic, so a dreadnought alone could
  not take the planet), `black_market_dealings_puts_secrets_and_cards_on_the_table` (+
  control `without_black_market_dealings_no_secret_or_card_shape_reaches_the_table`),
  `a_black_market_deal_moves_an_unscored_secret_objective` (the secret lands in b's hand,
  the flat good crosses over, the marker clears on completion) and the reverse-engineer
  pair `reverse_engineer_takes_a_played_component_card_out_of_the_pile` /
  `without_reverse_engineer_a_played_component_card_rests_in_the_pile` (b plays Industrial
  Initiative — the question-free component action — because Spy's forced steal would rob
  the RE holder of the very card it needs to play). The market fixtures seat both players
  on a shared hub with one fighter each: LRR 60 presence counts systems with units or
  controlled planets, never the home system, so a hub-only fixture has no LRR neighbours
  and no trade partner. Root causes found and fixed while landing the tests: the
  `SPACE_COMBAT_WON` emission swallowed the decider's `ScriptDiverged` (now propagated),
  salvage paid out `trade_goods` instead of `commodities`, and combat announcements are
  asked only in round 1 (the scripted arms were misaligned by the extra round-2 question).
- Workspace (LIBTORCH): every crate green — ti4-content 127, ti4-engine 1049, ti4-legacy
  25, ti4-mlp 64 + the three API/integration suites, ti4-model 74, ti4-policy 188,
  ti4-sim 52 (the v14 gate passes). Clippy: zero new warnings against the pre-batch tree
  (verified by stashing the batch and re-running `--all-targets`; the batch's
  `map_or_else`, let-chain and type-alias fixes landed in the test deciders and in
  `black_market_shapes`); the remaining warnings are pre-existing in untouched files. The
  eight touched files are rustfmt-clean (`--edition 2024 --check`); the repository's
  pre-existing fmt debt in untouched files was surfaced by a workspace-wide `cargo fmt`
  that was reverted file-by-file. Scratch probes and scripts deleted.
- Next safe action: the relics group from the handoff (10 relics, the last remaining
  content group after the two blocked action cards). Read `plans/BUG_2026-08-29_
  PRODUCTION_COMBINED_PAYMENT.md` before any `payment_faces` / `planet_value_now` /
  `price_of_under` restructuring (it stays OPEN/HIGH and this batch avoided all of it —
  no `production.rs` edits). `investments` and `lieinwait` remain blocked on unmodelled
  attachment / no transaction history.

### Engine completion — turn/status flow: Summit / Political Stability / Public Disgrace / Puppets on a String / Extreme Duress, re-baselined to v13 (2026-08-31)

- Active work branches: `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-rs` on `wp/r01-review-viewer-contract` and
  `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-work` on `wp/engine-completion` (synced back); both agreed on
  `a3e317c` before this batch (the combat-aftermath commit).
- Implemented (second implementer, per `plans/HANDOFF_ENGINE_COMPLETION.md` +
  `plans/PI_BRIEF_CARD_CONTENT.md`; user-confirmed full ownership, shared engine files in
  scope): **sub-batch C2 of the handoff's "not grouped" action-card set** — the five cards
  whose moments live in the turn/status/strategy driver: `summit` (Summit), `stability`
  (Political Stability), `disgrace` (Public Disgrace), `puppetsonastring` (Puppets on a
  String), `extremeduress` (Extreme Duress).
  - **Model fields** (`ti4-model`): `TransientFlags::PUPPET_ACTION (1 << 4)`; `Player
    .stability: bool` (`#[serde(default)]`) and `Player.duress_by: Option<PlayerId>`
    (`#[serde(default)]`) — both part of a seat's standing condition, so compared in
    `Player`'s manual `PartialEq` (unlike the in-flight C1 fields); `GameState
    .last_strategy_choice: Option<(PlayerId, StrategyCardId)>` (in-flight, not compared) —
    the draft choice Public Disgrace rolls back.
  - **Driver moments** (the moments the cards watch): the driver emits
    `STRATEGY_PHASE_BEGAN` for round 1 as well (one-time `Game.strategy_phase_announced`
    flag; previously only the `RoundEnded` branch fired at round 2+) so `summit` bites on
    the starting hand; `finish_status_phase` emits a per-seat `STRATEGY_CARDS_WOULD_RETURN`
    (When, payload `player` = seat) before that seat's token-gain settlement; `step()`
    emits `TURN_BEGAN` (After, payload `player` = active seat) after `start_turn` when the
    new active seat holds a readied strategy card.
  - **Summit** ("At the start of the strategy phase: Gain 2 command tokens."): the
    `STRATEGY_PHASE_BEGAN` After window; the effect calls `strategy_cards::gain_tokens`
    (made `pub(crate)`) for two tokens, each placed individually into a pool of the holder's
    choice (52.4).
  - **Political Stability** ("When you would return your strategy card(s) during the status
    phase: Do not return your strategy card(s). You do not choose strategy cards during the
    next strategy phase."): the When-window effect marks the seat; 81.8 keeps the marked
    seat's cards (readying the ones it spent, resetting `passed`) and skips the return and
    the report entry; `strategy_pick_order` / `next_strategy_picker` skip the marked seat in
    the following draft (`picks_this_round = dealt - retained`); the marker clears when that
    action phase begins and the retained cards return in the next round's status phase.
  - **Public Disgrace** ("When another player chooses a strategy card during the strategy
    phase: That player must choose a different strategy card instead, if able."):
    `take_timed_strategy_card` records `last_strategy_choice` before the emit; the effect
    returns the chosen card to the mat and re-asks the picker from the mat (the returned
    card excluded); `restore_first_choice` stands the first choice when "if able" offers
    nothing or the question fails.
  - **Puppets on a String** ("At the end of a player's turn, if you have passed: Perform 1
    action."): the window row is `PLAYER_PASSED` / After with the `actor_is` guard (only the
    seat that just passed is offered it); the effect arms `PUPPET_ACTION`; the `advance_turn`
    puppet branch runs the fresh action turn (`begin_action_turn` + `TURN_PUPPET:<seat>`,
    seat stays `passed`) and the advance after it moves on like any other passed seat.
  - **Extreme Duress** ("At the start of another player's turn, if they have a readied
    strategy card: If that player's next action is not a strategic action, they discard all
    of their action cards, give you all of their trade goods, and show you all of their
    secret objectives."): the `TURN_BEGAN` After window arms `target.duress_by = holder`;
    `Game::settle_extreme_duress(player, strategic)` runs at every action branch — in the
    synchronous branches *after* the played card resolves and consumes, in the strategic
    branch after `begin_strategic_action`: a strategic action lifts the duress quietly, any
    other action punishes (action cards discarded, all goods to the holder, the target's
    secret objectives shown to the holder, `EXTREME_DURESS:<target>`), and passing neither
    triggers nor lifts it.
- Coverage 130 → **135/142** action cards (95.1%, coverage_report); agendas still 63/63;
  reaction windows still 0 unsupported.
- **Re-baseline v12 → v13.** The largest move since v11: nine of the ten point estimates
  fell outside their v12 intervals (only `completion` is invariant). `faction_
  differentiation` narrows [0.541, 1.093] -> [0.378, 0.841] and `score_spread` [1.790,
  2.256] -> [1.531, 1.903] (Public Disgrace scrambles the draft — the main source of
  between-game divergence — and Extreme Duress strips a punished seat's goods); `vp_pace`
  falls [0.419, 0.469] -> [0.391, 0.443]; every action-label share falls by a few hundredths
  (new window/punishment events dilute the streams and punished seats take fewer actions).
  The v13 transcription into `behavior.rs` was verified bit-identical by the debug-mode gate
  test passing against it; the release re-run reports the same bounds and `0 metric(s)
  outside the recorded bounds` (dev and release recomputations are bit-identical in this
  batch). Old/new side by side in `plans/evidence/M08-021.md`.
- Tests: 1038 `ti4-engine` lib tests pass (was 1028): ten driver tests on a prompt-keyed
  `TurnDecider` (recorded plays as (seat, event, play-id); the action phase offers the
  action card first and the pass only once the seat's strategy cards are spent; pool
  questions answered with fleet) — `summit_gains_two_command_tokens_at_the_start_of_the_
  strategy_phase` (paired arm/control, same seed: arm fleet = control fleet + 2, other pools
  equal, the window-time `ACTION_CARD_PLAYED` present only in the arm),
  `political_stability_keeps_the_cards_and_skips_the_next_draft` (marker set and 2 cards
  retained mid-run; `STRATEGY_CARD_CHOSEN` count 10 vs the control
  `without_political_stability_every_seat_returns_and_drafts` at 12),
  `public_disgrace_puts_the_pickers_choice_back_on_the_mat` (+ control `without_public_
  disgrace_the_draft_keeps_the_first_choice`), `puppets_on_a_string_gives_the_passer_one_
  fresh_action_turn` (turn_seq 2, active back on the passer, still passed, the card spent;
  control `without_puppets_a_pass_is_final_until_the_phase_ends`),
  `extreme_duress_punishes_the_first_nonstrategic_action` (the target plays Spy — an
  "Action"-window card that needs no galaxy and silently no-ops: goods 4 to the holder, hand
  emptied, `EXTREME_DURESS:a`; control `without_extreme_duress_an_action_keeps_the_target_
  whole`) and `extreme_duress_lifts_when_the_target_takes_a_strategic_action`. Two
  pre-existing first-step tests now expect the round-1 `STRATEGY_PHASE_BEGAN` prefix. The
  ten drivers work as probes: with each card's dispatch entry removed the arm's board or
  event assertion fails exactly while the paired control arm still passes.
- Workspace (LIBTORCH): every crate green — ti4-sim 188/188, so the previously tracked red
  `fixture_capture_is_deterministic` (seed `919_601`) now passes as well. Clippy: the warning
  set is identical to the pre-batch tree (verified by stashing the batch and re-running);
  `effect_for` grew past 100 lines with the five new dispatch arms and carries the same
  documented `#[allow(clippy::too_many_lines)]` convention as `apply_choice`; the remaining
  workspace warnings are pre-existing in untouched files. Scratch examples deleted.
- Next safe action: sub-batch C3 of the handoff's ungrouped set — `salvage`, `reparations`,
  `infiltrate`, `blackmarketdealing`, `reverse_engineer` (economic/control). Read
  `plans/BUG_2026-08-29_PRODUCTION_COMBINED_PAYMENT.md` before any `payment_faces` /
  `planet_value_now` / `price_of_under` restructuring (it overlaps `reverse_engineer` /
  `salvage` territory). `investments` and `lieinwait` stay blocked on unmodelled attachment /
  no transaction history. Then relics (10).

### Engine completion — combat aftermath: Maneuvering Jets / Reflective Shielding / Courageous to the End / Crash Landing, v12 holds (2026-08-31)

- Active work branches: `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-rs` on `wp/r01-review-viewer-contract` and
  `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-work` on `wp/engine-completion` (synced back); both agreed on
  `1cbecd6` before this batch (the combat-dice commit).
- Implemented (second implementer, per `plans/HANDOFF_ENGINE_COMPLETION.md` +
  `plans/PI_BRIEF_CARD_CONTENT.md`; user-confirmed full ownership, shared engine files in
  scope): **sub-batch C1 of the handoff's "not grouped" action-card set** — the four
  reaction families that need live combat bookkeeping the model otherwise does not keep:
  `mjets1`–`4` (Maneuvering Jets), `reflective` (Reflective Shielding), `courageous`
  (Courageous to the End), `crashlanding` (Crash Landing).
  - **Model fields** (`ti4-model` `GameState`, all `#[serde(default)]`, in-flight so excluded
    from the manual `PartialEq`, `None` on a fresh state): `last_ship_destroyed =
    (system, owner, unit type)` — recorded by both announce paths (`combat::
    announce_ship_destroyed` and the `reactions::announce` `pending_destructions` drain) right
    before the `SHIP_DESTROYED` emit, because the event payload is consumed by the timing
    machinery and invisible to effects — and `pending_reflective_hits = (system, victim,
    hit count)`, staged by the card and drained by the engine.
  - **Maneuvering Jets** ("When the opponent's space cannon hits a ship: cancel the hits").
    The cannon step now **interleaves per gunner**: `AftermathWindow::new` rolls one gunner's
    cannon, emits that gunner's `SPACE_CANNON_HITS` and immediately absorbs that gunner's hits
    (`combat::absorb_hits_seeing`), instead of the old two-pass roll-all-then-ask-all — so a
    grant played in gunner G's window cancels G's hits. Grants use the shields batch' `combat:
    :grant_hit_cancellation` (two cancellable hits per copy) spent in `absorb_hits_seeing`.
  - **Reflective Shielding** ("When one of your ships uses SUSTAIN DAMAGE: that ship is hit 2
    times"). Both sustain-application paths (the direct `offer_sustain` and the settle
    window's `Stage::Sustaining` arm) now converge on `combat::emit_sustain_used`, which
    records `last_sustain`, emits `SUSTAIN_DAMAGE_USED`, and then drains a staged
    `pending_reflective_hits` through the real `absorb_hits_seeing` (sustain → cancellations →
    owner's destroy choice) when the producer's owner is not the holder. The When-window
    effect verifies the producer is the holder's own ship — a space-cannon hit is recorded
    with unit `"cannon"`, so cannon damage is not the holder's ship and the card is silent —
    and stages the two hits against the producer.
  - **Courageous to the End** ("When your last ship in the active system is destroyed: roll 2
    dice; for each die equal or lower than the destroyed ship's value, the opponent chooses
    one of their ships in the active system to destroy"). The After-window effect infers the
    opponent as the other combatant, rolls its two dice through the effect's real resolver,
    and takes each successful die through the engine's own `choose_casualty` (owner chooses,
    no decline) on the opponent's surviving ships; losses go to `pending_destructions` (the
    Direct Hit convention) so each is announced as its own `SHIP_DESTROYED` event with its own
    WHEN/AFTER windows.
  - **Crash Landing** ("When your last ship in the active system is destroyed: move 1 of your
    ground forces in the active system from the space area to an eligible planet"). The
    When-window effect moves one of the holder's ground-force types in space (auto-picked
    when the holder has exactly one such type, else chosen) to an eligible planet of the
    active system — never Mecatol Rex, auto-picked when exactly one planet, else chosen with
    no decline — and records `board.coexisting[planet]` when other units are already there.
    **Bug fixed along the way**: the `your_last_ship` guard read the event's `"last"` payload
    through the integer accessor, which returns `None` for a boolean payload — the window
    never opened for the effect; it now uses `event.boolean`.
- Coverage 123 → **130/142** action cards (91.5%, coverage_report, release); agendas still
  63/63; reaction windows still 0 unsupported.
- **No re-baseline.** The release `rebaseline_behavior` run (LIBTORCH) reported `0 metric(s)
  outside the recorded bounds` — every point estimate stayed inside its v12 interval, the
  protocol-recomputed intervals drifting only a few thousandths (`score_spread`'s upper bound
  easing 2.256 -> 2.178) — so v12 still holds and no v13 was needed: the interleave reorders
  scripted question order, and the four new cards bite only in fights their holders happen to
  bring into. The run is recorded side by side in `plans/evidence/M08-021.md`.
- Tests: 1028 `ti4-engine` lib tests pass (was 1024): four full-game scripted drivers in
  `game.rs` (pinned dice, `ObservingDecider` queue, each with a cardless control arm) —
  `maneuvering_jets_cancels_a_hit_from_the_opponents_cannon_roll` (a PDS-vs-cruiser fight: a
  degenerate combat with no `SPACE_COMBAT_RESOLVED`, the gun fires at the only ship present;
  the card arm keeps the cruiser, the control arm loses it),
  `reflective_shielding_turns_the_holds_sustain_into_hits_on_the_producer` (dreadnought pair,
  all-10 dice: B sustains A's hit, A sustains B's, the drain makes B absorb 2 — cruiser of
  the scripted choice, dreadnought auto — and loses both),
  `courageous_to_the_end_makes_the_opponent_choose_the_revenge_losses` (B fields four ships
  and **no fighters anywhere** — a destroyer's AFB barrage would consume pinned faces;
  B's dreadnought sustains A's hit, the four B dice take A's last cruiser, the two revenge
  dice make B surrender cruiser and destroyer and keep dreadnought + carrier) and
  `crashlanding_lands_the_holders_ground_force_when_their_last_ship_falls` (a two-ship
  fixture — a lone fighter in space would trip the fleet-capacity question on the Movement
  step; B declines to sustain and falls, A's cruiser falls as the last ship, A's infantry
  lands on the occupied planet and coexists with B's garrison). Pin-queue accounting is
  spelled out in each test's doc comment (fleet dice + AFB barrage + revenge dice in ask
  order). The four drivers double as the probes: with each dispatch entry removed the scripted
  arm's board assertion fails exactly while the control arm still passes.
- Known gaps (unchanged from the combat-dice batch): `destroy_fighters` still emits no
  `SHIP_DESTROYED` for AFB auto-destruction, so "after 1 of your ships is destroyed" windows
  never fire on AFB kills; the battlestation's stub resolver still closes SUSTAIN windows
  without a decider.
- Workspace (LIBTORCH): every crate green except `ti4-sim`'s pre-existing tracked
  `fixture_capture_is_deterministic` (unchanged failure mode; M09-019b scope). Scratch
  examples deleted; `behavior.rs` untouched (no version move).
- Clippy: zero new warnings in every touched file under `--all-targets` (`action_cards`,
  `combat`, `game` tests, `reactions`, `ti4-model` state); the remaining workspace warnings
  are pre-existing in untouched files (`close_vote`'s length, `production.rs` method chain,
  `strategy.rs` / `fracture.rs` casts, the `coverage_report` example's length).
- Next safe action: closed by the turn/status-flow entry above (sub-batch C2 landed);
  next is sub-batch C3 — `salvage`, `reparations`, `infiltrate`, `blackmarketdealing`,
  `reverse_engineer` (economic/control), then relics; `investments` and `lieinwait` stay
  blocked on unmodelled attachment / no transaction history. Read
  `plans/BUG_2026-08-29_PRODUCTION_COMBINED_PAYMENT.md` before any payment restructuring.

### Engine completion — combat dice: Direct Hit / Rout / Waylay, v11 holds (2026-08-31)

- Active work branches: `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-rs` on `wp/r01-review-viewer-contract` and
  `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-work` on `wp/engine-completion` (synced back); both agreed on
  `977a5e7` before this batch (the vote-order commit).
- Implemented (second implementer, per `plans/HANDOFF_ENGINE_COMPLETION.md` +
  `plans/PI_BRIEF_CARD_CONTENT.md`; user-confirmed full ownership, shared engine files in
  scope): the handoff's **combat-dice group** — `dh1`–`dh4` (Direct Hit), `rout` (Rout) and
  `waylay` (Waylay). This closes the group: the only other member, `intercept`, was already
  closed with `cc40c70`.
  - **Direct Hit** ("After another player's ship uses SUSTAIN DAMAGE to cancel a hit
    produced by your units or abilities: destroy that ship."). The sustain window records
    `GameState.last_sustain = (system, victim, unit type, producer)` *before* emitting
    `SUSTAIN_DAMAGE_USED` (a reacting card cannot read the payload of the event that summoned
    it); `Pending.producer` carries the hit's source player end to end. The effect stages
    the removal in the new in-flight slot `GameState.pending_destructions`
    (`#[serde(default)]`, not compared); the card's resolution step
    (`reactions::announce`) drains it through the game's resolver, so the destruction is a
    real `SHIP_DESTROYED` event that opens its own WHEN/AFTER windows — strictly narrower
    than the battlestation stub-resolver SUSTAIN gap. Guard: `direct_hit_guard` =
    `actor_is_not` + `event.text("producer") == player` (only the hit's producer may play).
  - **Rout** ("Your opponent must announce a retreat, if able"). Marker
    `Player.rout_round` (defender's seat) = `combat_round_seq` at play time; the window's
    Announcing step offers the attacker `["retreat"]` only while the marker matches the
    in-stage counter — the monotonic counter self-expires the marker at the next round and
    across combats, no cleanup. (Round N's Announcing stage runs at `combat_round_seq = N-1`;
    both sides read the same stable in-stage value.)
  - **Waylay** ("Before you roll dice for ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE: hits from this roll are
    produced against all ships (not just fighters)"). Self-buff on the holder's *own*
    round-1 barrage roll (`actor_is` on the new per-side `ANTI_FIGHTER_BARRAGE_STARTED`
    event, emitted in `roll_round` before each side's dice leave the bag, so the card cannot
    see or shape them); marker `Player.waylay_barrage_round`. That side's barrage hits are
    then assigned like ordinary hits — SUSTAIN first, then the owner chooses the losses —
    via `absorb_hits_seeing` instead of the silent `destroy_fighters`.
  - **Seams.** `CombatWindow::settle` / `settle_open` / `roll_round` and `apply_barrage` /
    `anti_fighter_barrage` / `anti_fighter_barrage_at` now thread `&mut Resolving` (synchronous
    callers build a stub with `timing: None`, whose `emit` records nothing) and return
    `CombatError`; the driver surfaces it as the pre-existing `GameError::Combat`. The
    registry's `action cards` ledger row is now source-aware (aliases count only if in the
    playset's sources) — required because `dh1`–`4`/`rout`/`waylay` are expansion-only and
    `implemented_never_exceeds_total` compares against the POK total.
- Coverage 117 → **123/142** action cards (86.6%, coverage_report, release); agendas still
  63/63; reaction windows still 0 unsupported.
- **Re-baseline v12.** The release `rebaseline_behavior` run (LIBTORCH) reported
  `0 metric(s) outside the recorded bounds` — every point estimate stayed inside its v11
  interval — but the bootstrap intervals themselves moved (the bots now hold and play the
  combat cards; `faction_differentiation`'s lower bound rises 0.431 -> 0.541,
  `score_spread`'s upper bound 2.091 -> 2.256), so the gate test's protocol-integrity check
  forced the move, exactly as v8 -> v9. The v12 transcription into `behavior.rs` was
  verified bit-identical by the debug-mode gate test passing against it; v11/v12 side by
  side in `plans/evidence/M08-021.md`.
- Tests: 1024 `ti4-engine` lib tests pass (was 1021): three full-game drivers in `game.rs`
  built on `combat_fixture` (a tactical fixture with the attacker seeded in every adjacent
  system so the defender has no retreat destination) plus `ObservingDecider`, which records
  the offered (player, prompt, option ids) of every question before answering from a
  `Scripted` queue — so the tests assert the *offered shape*, not just the outcome:
  `waylay_widens_the_owners_barrage_hits_to_all_ships` (pinned AFB hit lands on the cruiser
  with the card, on a fighter without; both fighters still die either way, so the cruiser's
  fate is the discriminator), `rout_forces_the_opponents_retreat_announcement` (the forced
  announcement offers `["retreat"]` only; control offers stay and retreat), and
  `direct_hit_destroys_the_ship_that_sustained_the_holders_hit` (all-10 dice: B's
  dreadnought sustains one hit, the card destroys it; the control arm keeps the damaged
  dreadnought — that ship's fate is the discriminator). Four probes (break → the exact test
  fails → revert): Direct Hit effect no-op, `pending_destructions` drain disabled, Waylay
  routed back to `destroy_fighters`, Rout's forced options disabled.
- Known gaps (documented, not fixed here): `destroy_fighters` still emits no
  `SHIP_DESTROYED` for AFB auto-destruction (pre-existing at `977a5e7`; "after 1 of your
  ships is destroyed" windows therefore never fire on AFB kills — fixing it would change
  reaction-card behavior across the board, a separate scope); the battlestation's stub
  resolver still closes SUSTAIN windows without a decider.
- Workspace (LIBTORCH): every crate green except `ti4-sim`'s pre-existing tracked
  `fixture_capture_is_deterministic` (unchanged failure mode; M09-019b scope).
- Clippy: zero new warnings in every touched file under `--all-targets` (test functions
  carry the conventional `too_many_lines` allows; `step_aftermath` — touched by the driver
  restructure and already over the line limit at `977a5e7` — now carries one too). The
  remaining workspace warnings are pre-existing in untouched files.
- Next safe action: the handoff's remaining groups in order — the 19 ungrouped action cards
  (the follow-up-batch list in `plans/CARD_CONTENT_STATUS.md`, each a full-game scripted
  scenario; note `reflective` binds to the existing `SUSTAIN_DAMAGE_USED` event), then
  relics. Read `plans/BUG_2026-08-29_PRODUCTION_COMBINED_PAYMENT.md` before any payment
  restructuring.

### Engine completion — vote order: Hack Election + the barred-speaker fix, v11 holds (2026-08-30)

- Active work branches: `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-rs` on `wp/r01-review-viewer-contract` and
  `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-work` on `wp/engine-completion` (synced back); both agreed on
  `d5009f2` before this batch (the sub-batch B turn-flow commit).
- Implemented (second implementer, per `plans/HANDOFF_ENGINE_COMPLETION.md` +
  `plans/PI_BRIEF_CARD_CONTENT.md`; user-confirmed full ownership, shared engine files in
  scope): the handoff's **vote-order group** — `hack` (Hack Election), "After an agenda is
  revealed: During this agenda, you vote last." This closes the vote-order group 3/3
  (`bribery`/`distinguished` were done in `cc40c70`).
  - **Marker.** `Player.hack_votes_last_agenda: Option<u32>` (new field in `ti4-model`,
    `#[serde(default)]`, in the manual `PartialEq`, `None` on a fresh seat): the `agenda_seq`
    the card was played into. `reveal_agenda` bumps `agenda_seq` before its window opens, so
    the marker binds to the vote that reveal produces — including a Veto replacement voted on
    in the same cycle — and expires at the next reveal with no cleanup (the
    `extra_votes_agenda` precedent).
  - **Order.** `VoteWindow::new` (vote.rs) now partitions the clockwise seating into hackers
    (marker == current `agenda_seq`) and the rest: the non-speaker seats in clockwise order,
    the speaker last if still voting, then the hackers at the very end (several hackers keep
    their relative clockwise order).
  - **Latent bug fixed.** The old code rotated the seating left by one, popped the old first
    seat and unconditionally re-pushed the speaker — re-seating a speaker who had been barred
    from voting (the Imperial Rider's prediction cost), re-admitting the barred seat and
    dropping the player on its left. A barred speaker is now simply gone from the order;
    `a_speaker_who_predicted_the_outcome_does_not_vote_on_it` (non-speaker exclusion) still
    pins the other case.
  - **Effect.** `hack_election` in `action_cards.rs` sets the marker; dispatch arm +
    `REGISTERED_ALIASES`. The window row ("After an agenda is revealed" → `AGENDA_REVEALED` /
    After) already existed — no new events, no new table row.
- Coverage 116 → **117/142** action cards (82.4%, coverage_report, release); agendas still
  63/63; the vote-order group is fully closed.
- **No re-baseline.** The release `rebaseline_behavior` run (LIBTORCH) reproduced all ten v11
  values to the last digit and reported `0 metric(s) outside the recorded bounds`: Hack
  Election reorders who is asked, not what is asked, and at the policy network's voting skill
  that perturbation does not move any batch metric off its v11 point. v11 still holds; the run
  is recorded in `plans/evidence/M08-021.md`.
- Tests: 1021 `ti4-engine` lib tests pass (was 1015): four `VoteWindow::new` unit tests
  (`hack_votes_last_moves_the_holder_to_the_end_of_the_order` — the holder takes the last seat
  behind the speaker; `several_hacks_take_the_last_seats_in_clockwise_turn`; `hack_votes_last
  _expires_with_the_agenda_it_was_played_into`; `a_speaker_who_predicted_the_outcome_gives_up
  _their_vote` — the new barred-speaker pin) plus two full-game drivers in `game.rs` built on
  a `RecordingDecider` that logs the (player, prompt) sequence: `hack_votes_last_in_the_
  agenda_vote` (three-seat agenda phase; b is asked in the reveal window and the outcome
  questions go to c, then the speaker a, then b; same two-to-one tally elects a; the card is
  spent) vs `without_hack_the_speaker_still_votes_last` (control: no one is asked in the
  reveal window; the outcome questions go to b, c, a). Two probes confirmed both halves (break
  → the exact test fails → revert): the hack partition disabled (both unit tests and the
  full-game driver fail on the exact order) and the old speaker re-seating restored (the
  barred-speaker test fails).
- Workspace (LIBTORCH): every crate green except `ti4-sim`'s pre-existing tracked
  `fixture_capture_is_deterministic` (unchanged failure mode; M09-019b scope).
- Clippy: zero warnings in every touched file under `--all-targets` (`vote`, `game`,
  `action_cards`, `ti4-model` state); the remaining workspace warnings are pre-existing in
  untouched files.
- Next safe action: the handoff's remaining groups in order — the 25 ungrouped action cards
  (the follow-up-batch list in `plans/CARD_CONTENT_STATUS.md`, each a full-game scripted
  scenario; note `waylay` is an anti-fighter-barrage roll-site modifier and `reflective`
  binds to the existing `SUSTAIN_DAMAGE_USED` event), then relics. Read

### Engine completion — turn-flow cards: Deadly Plot / Coup d'Etat / Crisis / Master Plan + v11 re-baseline (2026-08-30)

- Active work branches: `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-rs` on `wp/r01-review-viewer-contract` and
  `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-work` on `wp/engine-completion` (synced back); both agreed on
  `2853165` before this batch (sub-batch B of the handoff's agenda/turn-flow group).
- Implemented (second implementer, per `plans/HANDOFF_ENGINE_COMPLETION.md` +
  `plans/PI_BRIEF_CARD_CONTENT.md`; user-confirmed full ownership, shared engine files in
  scope): the group's remaining four cards — `deadly_plot`, `coup`, `crisis`, `master_plan`.
  This closes the agenda/turn-flow group 9/9.
  - **New typed turn events.** `STRATEGIC_ACTION_BEGAN` (typed, before anything resolves,
    with `player`), `TURN_PASSED` (typed, `player`), `ACTION_COMPLETED` (typed, `player`)
    join `EMITTED_EVENTS`; the driver also emits raw `TURN_RETAINED`, `TURN_SKIPPED:<player>`
    and `STRATEGIC_ACTION_CANCELLED:<card>`, and `close_vote` emits `AGENDA_DISCARDED:<alias>`.
    `advance_turn` now returns `Result<(), GameError>` because its `TURN_PASSED` window can
    trigger a decider error (a Crisis played into it); all nine call sites updated.
  - **`TransientFlags`** (new `ti4-model` type): a `u8` bitfield
    (`AGENDA_DISCARDED`, `STRATEGIC_CANCELLED`, `SKIP_NEXT_TURN`, `ADDITIONAL_ACTION`),
    `#[serde(default)]`, not compared by `GameState`'s manual `PartialEq`. A bitfield rather
    than bool fields because `GameState` was already at the three-bool lint limit
    (`struct_excessive_bools`); each flag is cleared where it is consumed, and an explicit
    pass declines the Master Plan grant, so no stale value can reach the next turn or agenda.
  - **`close_vote`** mirrors the ballot's votes into `state.agenda_votes` before emitting
    `AGENDA_RESOLVED` and clears them after (a guard can only read `GameState`, but the
    ballot lives in the vote window the driver holds). When `AGENDA_DISCARDED` is set it
    clears the elected-override and the holder's predictions, emits
    `AGENDA_DISCARDED:<alias>`, and skips the agenda effect, prediction payouts, law and
    elected feat while still running the occurrence scoring; `elected_player` stays unset.
  - **`advance_turn`** consumes `ADDITIONAL_ACTION` first (Master Plan: emits `TURN_RETAINED`
    and keeps the turn — same `turn_seq`, no end-of-turn processing, no transaction reset),
    then emits the typed `TURN_PASSED` window, then `SKIP_NEXT_TURN` (Crisis: the seat the
    turn just moved to is skipped — `TURN_SKIPPED:<player>`, no end-of-turn window).
  - **Coup d'Etat**: the strategic branch clears the cancel flag up front (checkpoint-retry
    safety), emits the typed `STRATEGIC_ACTION_BEGAN`, and if the flag is set emits
    `STRATEGIC_ACTION_CANCELLED:<card>` and ends the turn — `begin_strategic_action` mutated
    nothing, so the action is undone exactly as the card says: card in hand, unexhausted,
    no token, no ability. `finish_action()` (typed `ACTION_COMPLETED` + `advance_turn`) is
    wired into `close_tactical` and both `step_secondary` completion sites.
  - **Guards** now take `&GameState` (`fn(&Event, &PlayerId, &GameState) -> bool`): new
    `voted_or_predicted_another_outcome` (Deadly Plot: the holder's cast vote or standing
    prediction differs from the resolved outcome) and `at_least_two_players_have_not_passed`
    (Crisis: counts unpassed seats). `close_vote`'s discard path and the four dispatch arms
    (+ `REGISTERED_ALIASES`) finish the group.
- Coverage 112 → **116/142** action cards (81.7%, coverage_report, release); agendas still
  63/63; the agenda/turn-flow group is fully closed.
- **ti4-sim baseline moved v10 → v11** through the versioned process: `rebaseline_behavior`
  (release, LIBTORCH) printed old vs new; `behavior.rs` carries the v11 transcription and
  `plans/evidence/M08-021.md` records the pair. The largest re-baseline so far, and mostly
  changed *play* rather than dilution (agendas that vanish, strategic actions cancelled at
  their birth, skipped and doubled turns): `faction_differentiation` widens
  [0.457, 1.023] → [0.431, 1.128], `score_spread` [1.636, 2.082] → [1.643, 2.091],
  `vp_pace` barely moves (0.430 → 0.438), and every action-label share falls (the three new
  typed events dilute the denominators, Master Plan lengthens the streams, Crisis deletes
  turns). Six of the ten values sit outside their v10 intervals, so the value gate — not
  just the protocol-integrity check — forced the move; after the transcription the release
  run reports 0 metrics outside and the debug integrity check (recorded == protocol
  recomputation, 2000 splitmix64 resamples, seed `0x9E3779B97F4A7C15`) passes. `completion`
  stays the strict 1.0 invariant.
- Tests: 1015 `ti4-engine` lib tests pass (was 1007): 8 new — `deadly_plot_discards_the_`
  `agenda_when_the_holder_voted_otherwise` (a votes the loser with one planet and keeps the
  other; b's two stronger planets win; the agenda is discarded with no effect, no law, no
  feat, and *every* a-planet is exhausted, the kept one by the card's tail) and
  `deadly_plot_stays_silent_when_the_holder_backed_the_winner` (control: agenda resolves
  normally, card stays in hand); `coup_ends_the_turn_before_the_strategic_action_is_`
  `resolved` (the action is `STRATEGIC_ACTION_CANCELLED`, the turn passes, the strategy card
  is still in hand and still *unused*) vs `without_a_coup_the_same_strategic_action_`
  `completes` (the card completes and is exhausted); `crisis_skips_the_next_players_turn`
  (`TURN_SKIPPED`, the skipped seat gets no end-of-turn window, the turn lands on the third
  player) vs `crisis_never_fires_when_fewer_than_two_players_have_not_passed` (with two
  players the guard sees only one unpassed seat: both pass, no skip, card stays in hand);
  `master_plan_grants_an_additional_action_on_the_same_turn` (`TURN_RETAINED`, same
  `turn_seq`, a second action completes, then the turn passes) vs
  `without_master_plan_the_turn_passes_after_one_action`. Eleven probes, all confirmed
  (break → the exact test fails → revert): the four effect flags, the four driver paths
  (skip consumption, retention, coup abort, the `close_vote` discard branch), and the two
  new guards forced off.
- Two driver invariants the tests pin down: a voter who runs out of votable planets settles
  straight on (never offered a decline), and `votable_planets` offers in `(system, planet)`
  map order — the scripts match both.
- Workspace (LIBTORCH): every crate green except `ti4-sim`'s pre-existing tracked
  `fixture_capture_is_deterministic` (step 789, unchanged failure mode; M09-019b scope).
- Clippy: zero warnings in every touched file under `--all-targets` (`state.rs` stays at the
  three-bool lint limit because of `TransientFlags`); the remaining workspace warnings are
  pre-existing in untouched files (`close_vote`'s 109/100 lines was already over the limit
  at the batch base, 131 lines).
- Next safe action: the handoff's remaining groups in order — the ungrouped action cards
  (vote order: `hack`; the 25 ungrouped), then relics. Read
  `plans/BUG_2026-08-29_PRODUCTION_COMBINED_PAYMENT.md` before any payment restructuring.

### Engine completion — Agenda cards: Veto / Confusing / Confounding, no re-baseline (2026-08-30)

- Active work branches: `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-rs` on `wp/r01-review-viewer-contract` and
  `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-work` on `wp/engine-completion` (synced back); both agreed on
  `a5b4494` before this batch and both now carry this batch as `ae1b3a4`.
- Implemented (second implementer, per `plans/HANDOFF_ENGINE_COMPLETION.md` +
  `plans/PI_BRIEF_CARD_CONTENT.md`; user-confirmed full ownership, shared engine files in
  scope): the handoff's **agenda/turn-flow group, first sub-batch (the agenda cards)** —
  `veto`/`veto3`/`veto4` (Veto) and `confusing`/`confounding` (Confusing / Confounding Legal
  Text). All five reuse the existing `AGENDA_REVEALED` / `AGENDA_RESOLVED` window rows; no new
  events. The remaining four of the group (`deadly_plot`, `coup`, `crisis`, `master_plan`)
  still need new window rows and turn-flow hooks and are the next sub-batch.
  - **Veto** — the effect (played into the `AGENDA_REVEALED` window) draws the replacement
    from the top of the agenda deck and hands it to the driver via `GameState.agenda_veto
    _replacement`; a new helper `Game::reveal_agenda` (called from `open_next_vote`) discards
    the vetoed agenda and follows the replacement chain to the agenda that goes to a vote (a
    Veto on a Veto is legal; the chain is bounded by the finite deck).
  - **Confusing / Confounding** — both record `GameState.agenda_elected_override`
    (Confusing: the elected seat redirects to a chosen seat; Confounding: the holder takes the
    election for itself). `close_vote` reads it after the `AGENDA_RESOLVED` window: the vote's
    own result still settles predictions and any law, but the agenda's elected-player effect
    and the "elected by an agenda" feat follow the redirect (`AGENDA_OUTCOME_REDIRECTED`).
  - **Guard fix** — the `AGENDA_RESOLVED` payload gains an additive `elected_player` field,
    set only for a real seat, so the Confounding window (`another_player_elected`) can tell
    "a player was elected" from a law, a planet, or a For/Against outcome. A plain "outcome is
    not me" guard would fire on those.
- Coverage 107 → **112/142** action cards (coverage_report, release); agendas still 63/63.
- **No re-baseline.** The five cards are behaviorally inert for the recorded ti4-sim suite — the
  v10 bounds still reproduce exactly, protocol-integrity included — so the group needed no move
  (the last was v9 → v10 for Solar Flare / Lost Star Chart). The debug build's
  `the_suite_reproduces_and_stays_within_the_recorded_bounds` is green at v10.
- Tests: 1007 `ti4-engine` lib tests pass (was 1003): `veto_reveals_the_next_agenda_instead_of
  _the_vetoed_one` (driven over all three copies — the vetoed agenda is discarded, the
  replacement from the deck is voted on, the vetoed agenda is never voted, the outcome is
  untouched, the card is spent), `confusing_redirects_the_election_to_a_chosen_seat`,
  `confounding_makes_the_holder_the_elected_player`, and `confounding_is_silent_on_an_agenda
  _that_elects_no_player` (an Elect-Planet agenda names a planet, not a seat, so the window
  stays silent and the card stays in hand). Five probes confirmed each (Veto hook in
  `reveal_agenda` disabled / the `close_vote` override ignored / the confusing + confounding
  effects emptied / the Veto effect emptied / the Confounding guard reverted to the buggy
  raw-outcome reading → the exact test fails → revert).
- Workspace (LIBTORCH): every crate green except `ti4-sim`'s pre-existing tracked
  `fixture_capture_is_deterministic` (step 781, unchanged failure mode). Clippy is clean in the
  four touched files (`game.rs`, `reactions.rs`, `action_cards.rs`, model `state.rs`); the
  remaining workspace warnings are pre-existing in untouched files.
- Next exact action: begin sub-batch B (`deadly_plot`, `coup`, `crisis`, `master_plan`) —
  investigate their window texts, add the missing window-table rows and typed events, and drive
  the strategic-action / turn-end / agenda-resolution flow hooks in `game.rs`.

### Engine completion — Cancel API: Sabotage + v9 re-baseline (2026-08-30)

- Active work branches: `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-rs` on `wp/r01-review-viewer-contract` and
  `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-work` on `wp/engine-completion` (synced back); both agreed on
  `3325ab9` before this batch.
- Implemented (second implementer, per `plans/HANDOFF_ENGINE_COMPLETION.md` +
  `plans/PI_BRIEF_CARD_CONTENT.md`; user-confirmed full ownership, shared engine files in
  scope): the handoff's **Cancel API group** — Sabotage, all four copies (`sabo1`–`4`).
  "When another player plays an action card other than 'Sabotage': cancel that action card."
  - The machinery already existed: `reactions::announce` emits `ACTION_CARD_PLAYED` through the
    resolver and skips the card's effect when the event comes back cancelled (the card is still
    spent — 1.15 cancels the event, not the spend), and the Sabotage window row already existed
    in `window_table()`. This group added the two missing pieces:
  - **The cancellation itself.** The reaction slot that owns the triggering `ACTION_CARD_PLAYED`
    event is the only code that still holds that event (a card effect's signature carries no
    event; by the time the played card's effect runs, the triggering event is back in its own
    frame). The slot cancels the event after a successfully played Sabotage. The effect-table
    entry (`sabotage` in `action_cards.rs`) is a documented no-op marker so a played Sabotage
    reports as resolved rather than `ACTION_CARD_UNRESOLVED` — the doc says not to move the
    cancellation there.
  - **The "other than 'Sabotage'" guard.** The window row's guard is now
    `another_players_card_is_not_sabotage` (`actor_is_not` + the played card's alias read off
    the event payload is not one of `sabo1`–`sabo4`), so the four copies cancel other cards
    being played, not each other — a chain of Sabotages would spend the whole deck for nothing.
- Coverage 101 → **105/142** action cards (coverage_report, release); agendas still 63/63.
- **ti4-sim baseline moved v8 → v9** through the same versioned process: `rebaseline_behavior`
  (release, LIBTORCH) printed old vs new; `behavior.rs` now carries the v9 transcription and
  `plans/evidence/M08-021.md` records the pair. Cause: the bots now play Sabotage, so a card
  play the v8 bots let stand can be interrupted mid-announcement. Every v9 value sits inside
  its v8 interval (value gate green); what forced the move is the protocol-integrity check
  (recorded == protocol recomputation, 2000 splitmix64 resamples, seed
  `0x9E3779B97F4A7C15`). `completion` stays the strict 1.0 invariant.
- Tests: 1000 `ti4-engine` lib tests pass (was 998): `sabotage_cancels_the_card_being_played`
  (a `Game::step` driver — A plays Flank Speed in his activation's after window, B's Sabotage
  cancels the announcement: A's card and B's Sabotage are both spent, the `move_bonus`
  marker never lands, no `ACTION_CARD_UNRESOLVED`; cardless control arm sets the marker) and
  `sabotage_reacts_only_to_a_card_that_is_not_sabotage` (the guard at function level via
  `playable_now`: offered for another player's non-Sabotage card, not for a Sabotage play).
  All three halves probed (break → the exact test fails → revert): the slot's `event.cancel()`
  removed, the guard forced off, the dispatch entry deleted.
- Workspace (LIBTORCH): every crate green except `ti4-sim`'s `fixture_capture_is_deterministic`
  — the same pre-existing tracked failure, now at step 781 (was 782: the new card changes the
  replay trajectory, not its failure mode). M09-019b scope, not part of this batch.
- Clippy: zero warnings in every touched file under `--all-targets` (`reactions`,
  `action_cards`, `game` tests, `behavior` docs); the remaining workspace warnings are
  pre-existing in untouched files.
- Next safe action: the handoff's remaining groups in order — Movement (`lost_star`,
  `solar_flare`), Agenda/turn flow (9 cards), remaining relics. Read
  `plans/BUG_2026-08-29_PRODUCTION_COMBINED_PAYMENT.md` before any payment restructuring.

### Engine completion — Movement cards + v10 re-baseline (2026-08-30)

- Active work branches: `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-rs` on `wp/r01-review-viewer-contract` and
  `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-work` on `wp/engine-completion` (synced back); both agreed on
  `bd7b8f7` before this batch.
- Implemented (second implementer, per `plans/HANDOFF_ENGINE_COMPLETION.md` +
  `plans/PI_BRIEF_CARD_CONTENT.md`; user-confirmed full ownership, shared engine files in
  scope): the handoff's **Movement group** — Solar Flare (all copies, `solar_flare`) and Lost
  Star Chart (`lost_star`). Both are played in the existing "After you activate a system"
  window of the owner's own tactical action and set an activation-scoped marker on the seat
  (`Player.solar_flare` / `Player.lost_star`, the `blitz_invasion` / `war_machine_use` shape —
  the marker lapses when the next tactical action begins, so no cleanup):
  - **Solar Flare** — "During the 'Movement' step of this tactical action, other players cannot
    use SPACE CANNON against your ships": `combat::space_cannon_offense` reads the marker and
    suppresses the whole cannon step (no roll, no hit, no `SPACE_CANNON_HITS`). The engine's
    cannon step is the one that belongs to the named action, and every gun in it is another
    player's firing at the active player's ships — exactly what the card forbids.
  - **Lost Star Chart** — "During this tactical action, systems that contain alpha and beta
    wormholes are adjacent to each other": a new switch `Galaxy.wormhole_star_links`, re-derived
    at the top of every `Game::step` by `laws::apply_to_galaxy` from the active player's marker
    (no movement path can consult a map that forgot the card); `Galaxy::wormhole_partners`
    treats a both-wormhole system as linked to every other both-wormhole system while the
    switch is on. **On this map the effect is empty by the data**: 82b Mallice - Nexus is the
    only system carrying both an alpha and a beta wormhole, so a single such system has no
    partner; the rule is implemented as printed and pinned by the galaxy's own test. The
    historical oracle never implemented the card (policy weight 0.0 in every recorded
    baseline), so no oracle semantics were carried over.
- Coverage 105 → **107/142** action cards (coverage_report, release); agendas still 63/63.
- **ti4-sim baseline moved v9 → v10** through the same versioned process: `rebaseline_behavior`
  (release, LIBTORCH) printed old vs new; `behavior.rs` now carries the v10 transcription and
  `plans/evidence/M08-021.md` records the pair. The shift is the smallest of any re-baseline so
  far: the point estimates do not move at all and the bootstrap bounds move only in their last
  digits (the chart is inert on the base map; the flare bites only when the opponent parks a
  PDS in the system its owner activates and the shot would have hit, a corner the bots rarely
  reach in a thirty-game suite). Every v10 value sits inside its v9 interval (value gate
  green); what forced the move is the protocol-integrity check (recorded == protocol
  recomputation, 2000 splitmix64 resamples, seed `0x9E3779B97F4A7C15`). `completion` stays
  the strict 1.0 invariant.
- Tests: 1003 `ti4-engine` lib tests pass (was 1000): `solar_flare_keeps_the_opponents_space_
  cannon_dark_for_the_action` (a `Game::step` driver — A's cruiser and B's PDS in the activated
  system: the control arm rolls the gun, announces `SPACE_CANNON_HITS`, and loses nothing of
  B's; the card arm rolls and announces nothing and the cruiser is still in the system when
  the action ends; pins the marker and the spent card), `lost_star_points_the_map_at_the_
  chart_for_the_players_action` (the game's map points at the chart during the owner's action
  and not otherwise; a played chart is a resolved card, not `ACTION_CARD_UNRESOLVED`; control
  arm never points), `laws::the_star_chart_reaches_the_map_through_the_active_players_marker`
  (the laws wiring: on for the active player's matching activation, off for a different
  `activation_seq`, off when another player is active), and the galaxy-level
  `the_star_chart_rule_links_the_both_wormhole_systems` (a both-wormhole system links to every
  other such system, off-link kinds still pair by letter, the switch alone changes nothing on
  a map with no such system). Probes: cannon suppression removed (card arm rolls again), the
  laws' flag derivation pinned off (game-flow + wiring tests fail), both effect-marker pushes
  deleted, dispatch entries removed (the exact test fails each time → revert). The galaxy's
  both-link branch has no detecting probe — it is indistinguishable from same-letter matching
  by the map's data (documented in the test's doc comment).
- Workspace (LIBTORCH): every crate green except `ti4-sim`'s `fixture_capture_is_deterministic`
  — the same pre-existing tracked failure, still at step 781 (failure mode unchanged). M09-019b
  scope, not part of this batch.
- Clippy: zero warnings in every touched file under `--all-targets` (`action_cards`,
  `combat`, `laws`, `game` tests, `ti4-model` state, `ti4-content` galaxy, `behavior` docs);
  the remaining workspace warnings are pre-existing in untouched files.
- Next safe action: the handoff's remaining groups in order — Agenda/turn flow (`veto`,
  `veto3`, `veto4`, `confusing`, `confounding`, `deadly_plot`, `coup`, `crisis`,
  `master_plan`), then the remaining ungrouped cards. Read
  `plans/BUG_2026-08-29_PRODUCTION_COMBINED_PAYMENT.md` before any payment restructuring.

### Engine completion — invasion-flow cards + v8 re-baseline (2026-08-30)

- Active work branches: `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-rs` on `wp/r01-review-viewer-contract` and
  `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-work` on `wp/engine-completion` (synced back); both agreed on
  `967f464` before this batch.
- Implemented (second implementer, per `plans/HANDOFF_ENGINE_COMPLETION.md` +
  `plans/PI_BRIEF_CARD_CONTENT.md`; user-confirmed full ownership, shared engine files in
  scope): the handoff's **invasion-flow group** — Blitz, Disable, Parley, Ghost Squad. The three
  window rows already existed in `window_table()`; this group added the effects:
  - `blitz` — at invasion start: each of the invader's non-fighter ships in the active system
    without BOMBARDMENT gains BOMBARDMENT 6 until the end of the invasion. `roll_bombard_plan`
    precomputes the blitzed seats (via the `Player.blitz_invasion` activation marker) and grants
    such ships `(6, 1)`; the Bunker −4 penalty still applies to the blitzed roll.
  - `disable` — at invasion start in a system containing 1+ opponent PDS units: those PDS units
    lose PLANETARY SHIELD and SPACE CANNON during this invasion. `bombardable` skips the shields
    of holders marked with `Player.disable_invasion`; `space_cannon_offense` gates their cannons
    (the cannon step precedes INVASION_BEGAN, so the clause is inert in driven play but
    implemented for textual fidelity). The effect re-verifies the window text before marking.
  - `parley` — after another player commits units to land on a planet you control: the committed
    units return to the space area. The Committing stage records
    `GameState.last_committed_unit` (invader, system, planet, unit) right before the
    `UNITS_COMMITTED` emit; the effect hands that unit back to space, then combat proceeds
    against what is left on the planet.
  - `ghost_squad` — same window: move any number of your ground forces from any planet you
    control in the active system to any other planet you control. Whole (planet, type) groups
    move; the holder is re-asked until an explicit decline.
  - Markers: `Player.blitz_invasion` / `Player.disable_invasion` are per-seat `Vec<u32>` keyed by
    the invasion's activation seq (the `bunker_invasion` / `war_machine_use` precedent),
    `#[serde(default)]`, in `PartialEq`; they lapse when the next tactical action begins, so no
    end-of-invasion cleanup is needed. `last_committed_unit` is `#[serde(default)]` and not
    compared (a hand-off, not state a decider acts on).
  - Guard: the shared "after another player commits units to land on a planet you control" row is
    narrowed by `commit_on_your_planet = actor_is_not && controller_is`, so Parley/Ghost Squad
    fire only when the card holder actually controls the landed-on planet.
- Coverage 97 → **101/142** action cards (coverage_report, release); agendas still 63/63.
- **ti4-sim baseline moved v7 → v8** through the same versioned process: `rebaseline_behavior`
  (release, LIBTORCH) printed old vs new; `behavior.rs` now carries the v8 transcription and
  `plans/evidence/M08-021.md` records the pair. Cause: the bots now play the new cards —
  `faction_differentiation` and `score_spread` widen (upper bounds rise: a blitzed 6, an
  unshielded PDS, a returned landing and an evacuated garrison give invasions more ways to end
  differently), with sub-thousandth drifts in the action-mix shares. `completion` stays the
  strict 1.0 invariant; the debug-build integrity check (recorded == protocol recomputation,
  2000 splitmix64 resamples, seed `0x9E3779B97F4A7C15`) passes.
- Tests: 998 `ti4-engine` lib tests pass (was 994): `blitz_grants_bombardment_to_the_invaders_
  non_bombarding_ships` and `disable_strips_the_opponents_pds_effects_for_the_invasion`
  (game-level `Game::step` drivers with cardless control arms) plus
  `parley_returns_the_committed_unit_to_space` and
  `ghost_squad_relocates_the_holders_forces_before_the_fight` (window-level `InvasionWindow`
  committing-stage drivers with cardless control arms). All four probed (break the effect → the
  test fails → revert: the blitz grant arm, the disable filter, the parley marker hand-off, the
  ghost squad move loop).
- Workspace (LIBTORCH): every crate green except `ti4-sim`'s `fixture_capture_is_deterministic`
  — the same pre-existing tracked failure, now at step 782 (was 786: the new cards change the
  replay trajectory, not its failure mode). M09-019b scope, not part of this batch.
- Clippy: zero warnings in every touched file under `--all-targets` (lib and tests): `ti4-model`
  state, `combat`, `invasion`, `game`, `reactions`, `action_cards`, `behavior` (docs only) — the
  pass also cleared the long test functions by lifting the window-drive boilerplate into a shared
  `drive_invasion` helper and per-test run helpers, and moved the alias list to a const.
- Next safe action: the handoff's remaining groups in order — Cancel API (`sabo1`–`4`),
  Movement (`lost_star`, `solar_flare`), Agenda/turn flow (9 cards), remaining relics. Read
  `plans/BUG_2026-08-29_PRODUCTION_COMBINED_PAYMENT.md` before any payment restructuring.

### Engine completion — reroll dice group (commit B) + v7 re-baseline (2026-08-29)

- Active work branches: `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-rs` on `wp/r01-review-viewer-contract` and
  `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-work` on `wp/engine-completion` (synced back); both agreed on `ed8eea8`
  before this batch.
- Implemented (second implementer, per `plans/HANDOFF_ENGINE_COMPLETION.md` +
  `plans/PI_BRIEF_CARD_CONTENT.md`; user-confirmed full ownership, shared engine files in scope):
  the handoff's **reroll dice group** — Fire Team, Scramble Frequency, and the Aglnlan Oln
  (Jol-Nar) commander reroll.
  - Roll-site seam: `ti4-model` gained `reroll_staging` (per-roller staged dice: unit, planet,
    `hits_on`, faces) plus `last_reroll_player` (the "that player" of Scramble) on `GameState`;
    not part of `PartialEq` (dice, not state a decider can act on). Every ability roll site —
    ground combat, bombardment, space cannon, anti-fighter barrage — now stages its dice, opens
    the windows, recomputes hits from the possibly rerolled faces, and applies the removals.
  - Windows: the commander's inline "may reroll any of those dice" fires first for the roller
    (Munitions precedent, direct hook), then `GROUND_ROLLS_MADE` / `UNIT_ABILITY_ROLLED` open
    the other players' reaction slots: **Fire Team** ("your ground forces make combat rolls",
    `actor_is`) asks per die and rerolls the chosen subset; **Scramble Frequency** ("another
    player makes a BOMBARDMENT, SPACE CANNON, or ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE roll", `actor_is_not`)
    rerolls *all* of the roller's dice and asks nothing. A failed inner question degrades
    (keeps the die / skips the reroll) and combat continues.
  - Coverage 95 → **97/142** action cards (coverage_report, release); agendas still 63/63.
- **ti4-sim baseline moved v6 → v7** through the same versioned process: `rebaseline_behavior`
  (release, LIBTORCH) printed old vs new; `behavior.rs` now carries the v7 transcription and
  `plans/evidence/M08-021.md` records the pair. Cause: the bots now play the new cards — the
  visible shifts are `faction_differentiation` and `score_spread` narrowing (defenders can blunt
  a bomb roll), with sub-thousandth drifts in the action-mix shares. `completion` stays the
  strict 1.0 invariant; the debug-build integrity check (recorded == protocol recomputation,
  2000 splitmix64 resamples, seed `0x9E3779B97F4A7C15`) passes.
- Tests: 994 `ti4-engine` lib tests pass (was 991): `fire_team_rerolls_your_own_ground_dice_
  before_anyone_is_removed`, `scramble_frequency_rerolls_all_of_the_rollers_dice`, and
  `the_jolnar_commander_may_reroll_any_ability_die`, each with a decline arm. All three
  probed (break the effect → the test fails → revert); scratch examples deleted.
- Workspace (LIBTORCH): every crate green except `ti4-sim`'s `fixture_capture_is_deterministic`
  — the same pre-existing tracked failure, now at step 786 (was 781: the new windows change the
  replay trajectory, not its failure mode). M09-019b scope, not part of this batch.
- Clippy: zero warnings in every touched file (`ti4-model` state, `combat`, `invasion`, `game`,
  `reactions`, `leaders`, `action_cards`, `behavior`); the one remaining workspace warning is
  pre-existing in untouched `production.rs:183`.
- Next safe action: the handoff's remaining groups in order — Invasion flow (`blitz`,
  `disable`, `parley`, `ghost_squad`), Cancel API (`sabo1`–`4`), Movement (`lost_star`,
  `solar_flare`), Agenda/turn flow (9 cards), remaining relics. Read
  `plans/BUG_2026-08-29_PRODUCTION_COMBINED_PAYMENT.md` before any payment restructuring.

### Engine completion — coexistence bombardment choice + v6 re-baseline (2026-08-29)

- Active work branches: `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-rs` on `wp/r01-review-viewer-contract` and
  `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-work` on `wp/engine-completion` (synced back); both agreed on `f5b1acc`
  before this batch.
- Implemented (second implementer, per `plans/HANDOFF_ENGINE_COMPLETION.md` phase 2.4 +
  `plans/PI_BRIEF_CARD_CONTENT.md`; user-confirmed full ownership, shared engine files in
  scope): the **coexistence 7/7.1 bombardment target choice**, closed in `invasion.rs`.
  - `Stage::ChoosingBombardment` — a paused invasion stage surfaced through
    `pending_choice()`: when a bombarded planet's units belong to more than one defender, the
    window pauses and the table is asked, per bombarding unit, whose units take that unit's
    hits. Single-owner planets still resolve inline; the settle-pauses/driver-asks invariant
    is preserved (no inline `table.ask` in `settle`), and `InvasionWindow::drive` is overridden
    so a fresh window settles before its first question and stops when a scoring occurrence is
    queued (the pause belongs to the caller, exactly as between the window's own steps).
  - Roll-then-apply split: `roll_bombard_plan` is the dice-consuming half (same Bunker −4×count
    penalty as before; planets in `planet_units` key order, units in `units_of` order), shared
    by the window and the synchronous `bombardment` wrapper, so a seed rolls identically
    regardless of how the hits are later assigned. The old `debug_assert!(false)` announcement
    is gone; `bombardment` now threads `&mut Table` and returns `Result<usize, IllegalChoice>`.
  - 7.2: each unit's hits are capped at the chosen target's units on that planet and do not
    spill; `BombardedOutTheLastGroundForces` fires exactly as before (last ground force taken
    from a single victim and the planet left to the invader).
  - New test `a_coexisting_planets_bombardment_is_chosen_per_unit_and_capped_at_each_target`
    (B: 1 infantry, C: 2; a's three bombard units; scripted answers `c, b, c`): asserts the
    per-unit choices, the 7.2 waste (unit 2's surplus hit lands on empty-handed B, never on C),
    the questions offered (`[b,c] [b,c] [c]` — B stops being offered once it holds nothing),
    3 total kills, empty planet, and the dice count.
- **ti4-sim baseline moved exactly once (v5 → v6)**, per the handoff: `rebaseline_behavior`
  (release, LIBTORCH) printed old vs new; the recorded bounds in `behavior.rs` now carry the
  v6 transcription and `plans/evidence/M08-021.md` records the pair. Cause: bombs that used to
  evaporate on a coexisting planet (release build skipped it) now land as kills. Five metrics
  fell outside the v5 intervals; all ten v6 values sit inside v6; `completion` stays the strict
  1.0 invariant. The debug-build integrity check (recorded == protocol recomputation) passes.
- Tests: 991 `ti4-engine` lib tests pass (was 990). Probes (both caught by the new test, then
  reverted): a decider whose answer `resolve` ignored → `ScriptDiverged` at unit 2; a 7.2 cap
  that spilled across owners → 4 kills instead of 3.
- Workspace (LIBTORCH): every crate green except `ti4-sim`'s
  `fixture_capture_is_deterministic` — **pre-existing and unchanged by this batch** (identical
  failure on `f5b1acc`: seed `919_601`'s replay finishes at step 781 before any production-head
  menu of ≥3 options). It lives in the M09-019b profile module with its own versioned process
  and is tracked, not part of the handoff's mandated re-baseline.
- Clippy: zero new warnings in the touched files; this rework also cleared the `f5b1acc`
  long-function warning in `invasion.rs` (102/100 lines).
- Next safe action: commit B of the handoff's Reroll group — `fire_team`, `scramble`, and the
  Jol-Nar commander reroll on the now-real roll-site decision seam — then the remaining groups
  (Invasion flow, Cancel API, Movement, Agenda/turn flow, relics).

### Engine completion — scoped roll modifiers + production window (2026-08-29)

- Active work branches: `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-rs` on `wp/r01-review-viewer-contract` (this
  session's commits) and `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-work` on `wp/engine-completion` (synced
  back); both agree on `c18c276` before this batch.
- Implemented (second implementer, per `plans/HANDOFF_ENGINE_COMPLETION.md` +
  `plans/PI_BRIEF_CARD_CONTENT.md`; user-confirmed full ownership, shared engine files in
  scope): the handoff's **scoped roll modifiers + production reaction** group.
  - `f_prototype` — `Player.fighter_bonus_round` (`ti4-model`), 2 per copy for the combat round,
    fighter units only, consumed in `combat::effective_hits_on` and the anti-fighter barrage.
  - `bunker` — `Player.bunker_invasion`, +4 per copy to the planet controller's bombardment
    threshold for that invasion (`invasion::bombardment_at`).
  - `war_machine1`–`4` — `Player.war_machine_use`, +4 value / −1 cost = 5 faces folded into
    `production::capacity`/`available` for the activation played in.
  - Production window timing: `PRODUCTION_USED` now fires **at step entry** (with player+system
    payload) via `AftermathWindow::enter_production`, gated on `capacity > 0`, so a War Machine
    played in the `After` window buys into the step it answers; the pending choice is refreshed
    with the grown budget. `PRODUCTION_RESOLVED` still fires after the step. Random-batch wiring
    guard updated (no producing unit ⇒ window never opens in that batch; the positive proof is
    the `game.rs` driver test).
- Tests: 990 `ti4-engine` lib tests pass (was 986), each effect probed (break the consumption
  site → its test fails → revert: fleet threshold, AFB guard, bombardment penalty, production
  budget). Coverage 89 → **95/142** action cards (coverage_report, release).
- Workspace: all engine-line crates green; **ti4-sim's two suite tests are red on the
  pre-change baseline `c18c276` too** (verified by running the clean work repo) and are tracked,
  not new: the coexistence 7/7.1 bombardment target choice (`invasion.rs` announcement, phase
  2.4 of `plans/ENGINE_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`) became reachable once `exchange_program` landed,
  and the recorded sim baseline/fixture predate that trajectory shift.
- Next safe action: the handoff's next group — thread a decision interface into
  `bombardment_at`/`roll_ground` (coexistence 7, 7.1 target choice per bombarding unit; unblocks
  `fire_team`, `scramble`), then re-record the ti4-sim baseline and fixture through their
  versioned processes and re-run the workspace green. `plans/CARD_CONTENT_STATUS.md` updated
  (coverage, remaining-card groups, verification state).

### R01 independent review-viewer track (2026-08-28)

- **Authorization:** the operator requested a native, omniscient reviewer for real learned-policy
  simulations, confirmed its requirements interview-style, and waived independent review/package
  cadence for this add-on only. It remains separate from TTS and does not change M00–M13 sequencing
  or M10 training acceptance.
- **Branch:** `wp/r01-review-viewer-contract`.
- **Implementation:** `ti4-review` now loads a schema-6 MLP bundle or legacy profile checkpoint and
  a map pool, creates the exact
  training-equivalent six-seat starting table, and drives the simulator directly. It can advance by
  engine step, resolved decision, top-level action, a bounded variable count, round, or whole game;
  Stop takes effect at a clean engine-step boundary. The default no-argument command opens a native
  GUI with input buttons, seed/rotation/profile selectors, omniscient board/player/decision panes,
  a view-only timeline, autosave/reopen, and standalone HTML export.
- **Trace fidelity:** every decision resolved within an engine step is retained, including nested
  choices, with all legal options, scores, probabilities, and projected feature values. Linear
  profiles additionally expose exact weights/contributions; MLP rows are labelled nonlinear.
  Frame zero is the post-deployment table before the first `Game::step()`.
- **MLP checkpoint repair:** selecting either `manifest.json` or `slots.json` resolves the containing
  schema-6 bundle and verifies its full inventory through `ti4_mlp::bundle::read`. The operator's
  exact `run-011/checkpoint-154720/slots.json` path now produces a validated real decision with 8/8
  scored options, 8/8 probabilities, and 396 projected feature rows.
- **Visual follow-up:** fixed seat colors now connect player sheets, planet ownership, space control,
  and units. Exclusive ship control draws a thick colored system edge; planets are independently
  colored circles with resources/influence, trait, specialty, and legendary labels. True unit base
  classes use distinct geometric symbols with stack counts/damage/galvanize markers. Player holdings
  are grouped into human-readable illustrated sections. Native and standalone HTML renderers share
  this contract.
- **Active v3 compatibility:** the operator confirmed the current models returned to frozen OOV
  registry v3. Bundle inference accepts exact v3/v4 layouts without renumbering; v3 current-only
  `action-plan` facts route to global OOV, while normal vocabulary load/build stays strict v4. A real
  update-532156 v3 bundle resolved and recorded an 8-option strategy decision; v1/v2 remain refused.
- **Startup convenience:** bounded atomic local settings restore the last checkpoint/profile-table
  and map-pool selections. `Previous game` opens the remembered valid saved/autosaved review, with a
  newest-review fallback under `out/reviews`.
- **Human action review:** an action unit is now the whole active-player period, ending only on the
  canonical turn handoff/phase boundary. Revealed public objectives and durable action summaries are
  shown in native and HTML views; summaries cover choices, systems, unit movement/change, planet
  control, scoring, and transaction terms/outcomes. Existing review files reconstruct the corrected
  boundaries/summaries in memory from their retained frames.
- **Verification:** formatting, focused add-on and touched-crate Clippy, 6 reviewer tests, the full
  workspace test suite, diff checks, both learner/accepted profile smokes, session validation, HTML
  rendering, and native GUI startup passed. A complete learned game produced 2,923 frames, 2,922
  steps, 3,233 decisions, and 1,754 actions with outcome `Completed`.
- **Commit and evidence:** packaged as `R01: build interactive learned-game reviewer`;
  `plans/evidence/R01-IMPLEMENTATION.md` contains commands, measured bounds, and results. Unrelated
  untracked sample artifacts remain untouched.
- **Next action:** launch with `cargo run -p ti4-review`; there is no remaining R01 implementation
  action in the confirmed scope.

### Codex Stage-1 parity repair checkpoint (2026-08-13)

- Active branch: `codex/stage1-parity-fixes`; the pre-existing local edit to
  `crates/ti4-training/examples/stage1_curve.rs` remains uncommitted and was not incorporated into
  this package.
- Implemented scope: collision-free schema-3/4/5 profiles; Python-style explicit option and board
  features; factual engine choice payloads; faction-keyed gradients; full seat rotations over
  shared maps; an exact high-level Python reference plan; and a comparison executable with
  representation, rotation, rollout, and solved-checkpoint gates.
- Semantic result: the repaired Rust run now learns useful opening motion immediately, but the
  Python solved checkpoint still fails transfer (96 seat-games/faction: Hacan 0.000, Jol-Nar
  0.000, Letnev 0.010 clearance). This is reported as a failed gate, not parity.
- Evidence: `docs/STAGE1_PARITY_COMPARISON.md` and
  `plans/evidence/CODEX-STAGE1-PARITY.md`. Final workspace verification is recorded there.
- Follow-up (2026-08-14): the driven strategy-card blocker is implemented for all eight cards and
  both active Thunder's Edge replacements. Primaries, accepted secondaries, shared/faction cost
  rules, Brilliant substitution, and TE Warfare's deferred free tactical action are wired. See
  `docs/STRATEGY_CARD_PARITY.md`.
- Map follow-up (2026-08-14): the Save-54 map-shape blocker is closed for parity/training runs.
  `ti4-sim::MapPool` reads and validates the exact Python JSON.GZ artifact; Stage-1 rotation,
  evaluation and training accept it with the Python `seed + 20,000,000` rule. On identical 32 pool
  selections, Python clearance is Hacan/Jol-Nar/Letnev `0.969/0.979/0.865`, while Rust is
  `0.312/0.292/0.010`. The remaining transfer failure is now isolated to game/choice execution,
  not map distribution. Evidence: `plans/evidence/CODEX-STAGE1-MAP-PARITY.md`.
- Solved-transfer follow-up (2026-08-14): the same-pool gate now passes at Hacan/Jol-Nar/Letnev
  `0.865/0.865/0.823` after propagating FULL sources, aligning technology identities, Gravity
  Drive, Transit Diodes, TE expeditions, Gravleash, faction production units, and the Python
  distance-zero `target:reachable` feature, then closing the implemented learned-window routing
  class. Stateful nested choices now receive `Observed`; Integrated Economy, learned Orbital Drop
  and Peace Accords targets, Psychoarchaeology, Chaos Mapping, Predictive Intelligence, and
  Bio-Stims are wired. This validates the imported policy representation and basic execution path,
  not complete engine parity. Unsupported content/event ordering remains documented in
  `docs/STAGE1_PARITY_COMPARISON.md`.
- Training optimization follow-up (2026-08-14): schema-4 profiles are shared through `Arc`, Rayon
  provides persistent work-stealing rollout execution, workers return deterministic sufficient
  statistics, and faction/head merges are parallel. The Stage-1 reference path measures about
  `0.091 s/update` versus `0.41` before this package and the historical optimized Python `0.556`.
  Stage 2 is wired to the same core with four-round rewards, six factions/rotations, the real
  Save-52 pool, blank or checkpoint bootstrap, faction evaluation, and atomic checksummed resume
  artifacts. See `docs/TRAINING_PIPELINE.md` and
  `plans/evidence/CODEX-TRAINING-PIPELINE-OPTIMIZATION.md`.

### Codex Stage-2 stall investigation (2026-08-14)

- Objective: explain why Stage-2 training has been flat since bootstrap (mode A — alive process,
  no promotions across ~1,100 updates) and test the candidate remedies against real artifacts.
  Failure modes B/C were ruled out by the operator before this package.
- Safepoint: commit `66fd234`, tag `safepoint/stage2-stall-baseline`; created before any new edit;
  rollback point for this investigation.
- T0 forensics on `out/stage2_*.json`: the champion is frozen at its bootstrap state across every
  recorded boundary; candidate aggregate gains over n=8 boundaries average ≈+0.4 with no trend;
  learner weights differ from the champion in ~80% of cells but |Δ| is small (mean ≈0.0014) — a
  random walk around bootstrap rather than drift.
- Telemetry correction: per-update weight movement scales exactly linearly with `learning_rate`
  (≈0.034/update at lr=0.03 vs ≈0.011–0.015/update at lr=0.01 in T2). The earlier "lr test
  inconclusive" reading was a block-length artifact — that run used `every=50` blocks, so raw
  totals looked half-sized.
- T1 eval-only at the frozen 5700 state, n=32 seeds × 6 rotations (`out/eval_t1_5700_n32.json`):
  paired gain **+0.188, SE 0.180** (2σ bar 0.361) and **no veto violations**. The repeated n=8
  "clearance regressions" were panel noise at 48 games/faction; the state genuinely is not
  promotable yet. Revised diagnosis: the stall is ≈zero optimizer drift, not gate miscalibration —
  the gate's refusal was correct at adequate resolution.
- Instrumentation in `crates/ti4-training/examples/stage2_training.rs` (gate boolean behavior
  preserved; 11/11 example tests pass): clause-level rejection reasons via
  `failed_stage_two_clauses`, console logging of every un-promoted boundary's rejecting clauses,
  an `--eval-only` mode with JSON sidecar, and a `--learning-rate` knob recorded in checkpoint
  arguments.
- T2 differential run complete (finished 2026-08-14 20:34 WEDT, 3309 s for 1000 updates): resume
  @4600 from `out/stage2_from_stage1.json`, lr 0.01 versus the baseline lineage's 0.03 at identical
  absolute update positions, n=32 boundaries every 100 → `out/stage2_test_lr001_n32.json` (log
  `out/logs/t2_lr001.log`). Every boundary gain is within ≈1.4σ of zero (mean −0.15); no promotions
  in either run; per-faction weight displacement from the shared champion scales with lr×updates
  (~0.36 ratio vs 0.30 step-budget ratio) — directionless exploration, no drift at either learning
  rate.
- **Final diagnosis (evidence-backed): the stall is a zero-signal optimization problem.** Four-
  round games compress outcomes into near-ties, so centered REINFORCE credit has ≈no directional
  information; entropy-regularized steps random-walk around bootstrap. Gate rejections are all
  correct; n=8 panels had been adding noise-driven vetoes and over-reading gains by +0.2–0.5 (fixed
  seed set reused at every boundary). Learning rate is not a lever; reward signal is.
- T3 Python-oracle parity audit (read-only, `D:/Projects/ti4-engine/out/stage2_pg_six_c_*.json`
  + trainer source): the oracle's Stage-2 **did** promote under its configuration
  (sol@u3350, xxcha@u3450, isolated path) — promotion-grade improvement emerges around u≈3350–
  3450 there. Full parity table: horizon, lr/entropy/clip, 96 seat-games/update batch, map pool,
  gate tolerances, reward math (golden-verified port), update law (line-level equivalent), weight
  movement magnitude, and full-decision trajectory capture are all equal. Rust is strictly
  *stricter* in three places: extra paired-σ clause (`--accept-sigmas 0` restores oracle gate),
  VP-only isolated-path improvement test (no clearance tiebreak), and eval cadence every 100 vs
  the oracle's 50. None of these explain zero drift; they must be matched for a fair parity run.
- Panel decorrelation implemented in `stage2_training.rs`: opt-in `--panel-step N` gives each
  boundary k a fresh disjoint seed block (`base + k·N`); default 0 keeps the historical fixed
  panel bit-for-bit. Per-boundary first seeds recorded in history entries (`validation_first_seed`,
  serde-defaulted) and checkpoint arguments; smoke run `out/smoke_panel_step.json` confirms
  boundary seeds 96000000/96000003/96000006. Two new unit tests (default unchanged; disjoint
  blocks).
- Checks: `cargo test -p ti4-training` 98/98 lib + 13/13 example; clippy clean; rustfmt applied;
  T2 binary built pre-fmt (cosmetic-only later edits).
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/STAGE2-STALL-INVESTIGATION.md`.
- T4 oracle-parity run: attempt 1 (PID 8752) killed at ~u4729 after its first two boundaries exposed
  a pairing-contract bug — with `--panel-step` on, fresh candidate panels share no source seeds with
  the champion's bootstrap measurement, so `GainEvidence::paired` degenerated to `samples=0,
  gain=+0.000` at every boundary and the margin clause could never fire (artifact preserved as
  `out/stage2_t4_attempt1_brokenpairing.json`, log
  `out/logs/t4_oracle_parity_attempt1_brokenpairing.log`). Fix in the loop: stepping mode now
  re-measures the incumbent on each boundary's fresh validation+confirmation panels before any paired
  comparison (default fixed-panel mode untouched). Relaunched ~22:05 WEDT as PID 18224 with the same
  pre-registered config (`--updates 3500 --every 50 --validation-seeds 32 --confirmation-seeds 32
  --accept-sigmas 0 --panel-step 32` + save52 pool), output `out/stage2_t4_oracle_parity.json`,
  log `out/logs/t4_oracle_parity.log`. Regression check on relaunch: first boundary must show
  `source seeds=32`, not 0.
- T4 decision rule (pre-registered): ≥1 promotion by u≈3500 = oracle parity achieved → the stall
  was gate strictness + budget, and the promoted table is promotable evidence. Zero promotions ⇒
  implementation-level game/feature divergence from the oracle → frontier-model differential
  diagnosis (do not tune hyperparameters further). `--rounds 8` deprioritized by operator;
  train-seeds=64 and reward re-examination remain fallbacks.
- T4 ETA ≈ 6–7 h (~04:00–05:00 WEDT): T2 training rate (≈3.28 s/update) plus 3 panels per boundary
  in stepping mode (incumbent validation + incumbent confirmation + candidate). Monitor via log tail /
  checkpoint history; first boundary at update 4650.
- T4 status ~00:10 WEDT: u6350/8100 (~78%), no promotions yet, all rejections clearance-veto driven
  (mostly sol trading round-1 openings for mid-game VP). Real positive drift has emerged under valid
  paired statistics (gains trending upward with updates; several +0.3–0.6 aggregate boundaries vetoed on
  per-faction clearance). Revised ETA ~02:30–03:00 WEDT.
- T4 CPU under-saturation diagnosis (operator question): **structural, not a bug.** Verified absent:
  sleeps/deadlines/locks in engine+training code; memory pressure (93 GB RAM, ~37 GB free); map-pool
  I/O (fully in-memory Vecs); checkpoint races (atomic tmp+rename — two concurrent `--eval-only` readers
  of the live file came up clean). Measured: a 192-game panel takes only ~4–6 s wall when cores are free,
  so training blocks are one short Rayon wave per update (~3 s, 96 tasks/32 threads) with barriers between
  updates and variable game-length tails => oscillating 25–78% of all cores; stepping-mode rejected
  boundaries run up to **10 panels** (incumbent x2 + candidate + isolated per-faction fallback x6, silent in
  the log except final clause lines) as a sequence of short waves with small serial gaps => the long
  low-CPU stretches seen in Task Manager. Measured pace ≈5.0 s/update incl. ~87 s/boundary matches u6350.
  Correctness is scheduling-independent; making eval faster would save <20% wall — not worth a mid-run
  rebuild/restart. Post-T4 option recorded: pre-filter the isolated fallback on the validation panel
  (gate semantics unchanged) to cut rejected-boundary cost ~3x for future runs.

- T4 ended by operator decision (~00:55 WEDT) at u6700/8100 after the operator judged the run a
  failure ("none of the VPs have moved"). Final state preserved in `out/stage2_t4_oracle_parity.json`
  (last boundary u6700, gain +0.490; 43 boundaries total, zero promotions). Run data: paired gains
  first half mean +0.125 -> second half +0.391; 17/42 boundaries cleared the +0.30 oracle margin; all
  rejections clearance-veto driven (rotating factions: sol early, letnev/l1z1x late). The operator's
  read on absolute VP levels is correct by construction (4-round horizon compresses everything to
  ~2.0 mean VP); the champion column only moves on promotion and there were none.
- Operator direction (supersedes the Rust-bootstrap T5 plan, which is withdrawn): re-run the PYTHON
  pipeline itself as a control retest — its own stage-1 champions through Stage-2 with the latest
  Python stage-2 settings; "basically no rust". Oracle repo stays read-only: trainer runs from an
  external cwd (PYTHONPATH + PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 + PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX into this repo), all
  outputs redirected here; `git -C D:/Projects/ti4-engine status --short` verified unchanged after
  launch (one pre-existing untracked doc).
- Python retest launched ~01:25 WEDT, PID 65312 (+~30 worker processes):
  `python D:/Projects/ti4-engine/tools/train_stage1_policy_gradient.py --stage 2 --horizon 4
  --resume D:/Projects/ti4-engine/out/stage1_pg_six_to5000_20260810.json (u3050, schema-4 auto-migrated
  to 5 exactly as the original chain) --out out/py_retest_stage2_pychamp.json --updates 500` with the
  latest recorded segment settings verbatim: seed 74000000 (same panels + training stream as the
  original chain), train_seeds 16, validation/confirmation/audit seeds 32, eval_every 50, workers 30,
  lr 0.03, entropy 0.01, clip 1.0, vp/objective/secret weights 1.0/0.35/0.25, clear_bonus 22, r1_bonus
  3.0, r1_shaping 0.1, expansion 2.0, unit 1.0, accept_vp_margin 0.05, max faction clearance/vp/shortfall
  regression 0.03/0.15/0.10, shortfall margin 0.15, game_seconds 30, save52_e400_n8192 pool, six
  factions sol,letnev,xxcha,hacan,jolnar,l1z1x, progress_interval 8, surrogate snapshots on (into this
  repo). The original chain's three segments were each manually stopped early (+100/+100/+250 new
  updates); --updates 500 covers their full span (promotions landed at +300 sol@u3350 and +400
  xxcha@u3450) in one run to completion, ending u3550.
- Python retest COMPLETED 02:54 WEDT (~87 min wall, run_complete=True, u3550). Verdict: old system
  works and reproduces -- gate decisions identical at 9/10 boundaries (u3100 assembled all-six,
  u3350 isolated sol both reproduced); trajectories bit-identical through u3150 then small drift from
  u3200 (Python pipeline is not run-reproducible: wall-clock game_seconds abandonment + parallel
  reduction order), and the single flip is xxcha@u3450 -- original's swap passed all gate clauses
  comfortably (+0.474 vs 0.300 aggregate) while this run's drifted swap failed two (aggregate +0.016;
  sol VP veto -0.172). Start->final: total VP 8.042 -> 11.562 accepted (+3.52), learner 12.582
  (+4.54); per-faction table in plans/evidence/STAGE2-STALL-INVESTIGATION.md. Most of the gain is the
  horizon reorientation jump in the first 50 updates (stage-1 champion was horizon-1 trained).
- Next safe action: decide with the operator between (a) the decisive differential experiment -- run
  the Rust stage2_training.exe from this same Python stage-1 champion file (schema-compat check of
  `D:/Projects/ti4-engine/out/stage1_pg_six_to5000_20260810.json` against the Rust checkpoint format
  first) with T4-equivalent settings, comparing boundary-by-boundary; or (b) close out the
  investigation here and commit the retest artifacts + evidence. Note the comparability caveat: T4's
  resume point was already past its own reorientation jump, so its zero-promotion stretch is not
  directly comparable to Python's +300/+400 promotions from raw stage-1 champions.

### M08-005 tactical scoring checkpoint (2026-08-13)

- Active branch: `wp/m08-005b-tactical-scoring`, based on `8a72a4f`; the focused local package
  commit is `Score tactical activations from public board state` (see current Git HEAD).
- Completed scope: M08-005 tactical scoring is closed through M08-005b/d. `Observed` reports the
  active system and derives public movement reachability; `ScoredBot::choose_seeing` values
  systems, removes useless activations from its own shortlist, declines idle reinforcements, loads
  transport toward a prize, avoids surplus landings, and favors lift when troops are stranded.
  Planet-only stranded troops are correctly counted. Existing casualty/sustain/retreat rules
  remain in the shared dispatcher; plain `choose` remains the blind fallback.
- Next package: M08-006 economy/development scoring, followed by M08-007 objectives.
- Verification: `cargo fmt --all --check`; `cargo test -p ti4-policy` (40 passed); `cargo test -p
  ti4-engine` (703 unit + 5 doc tests passed); `cargo clippy -p ti4-policy -p ti4-engine
  --all-targets -- -D warnings`; and `git diff --check` all passed. Oracle integrity guard passed
  before and after. Focused mutation checks failed as intended and were restored.
- Simulator diagnostic: 24 scored games, 80 objective scores, top VP range 1–6; all still end
  `objectives_exhausted` in round 9. This is progress evidence only, not a parity or speed claim.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/M08-005b.md`, `plans/evidence/M08-005c.md`,
  `plans/evidence/M08-005d.md`. Next safe action after committing is M08-006.

### M08-006a public development checkpoint (2026-08-13)

- Active branch: `wp/m08-006-economy-development`, based on `7fa7460`; focused local package
  commit follows this state update.
- Completed scope: observed research favours a missing colour path or a progressing unit-upgrade
  route from face-up cards; strategy-card choice uses printed public roles; observed token gain
  uses oracle `6 / 5 / 3` diminishing-return pool needs. Unknown or out-of-scope content retains
  the blind fallback.
- Verification: oracle integrity guard passed; `cargo fmt --all --check`; `cargo test -p
  ti4-policy` (45 passed); `cargo test -p ti4-engine` (703 unit + 5 doc tests passed); `cargo
  clippy -p ti4-policy -p ti4-engine --all-targets -- -D warnings`; and `git diff --check` all
  passed. A deliberately inverted colour-gap mutation failed its focused decision-boundary test
  and was restored.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/M08-006a.md`. Next safe package: M08-006b strategy-secondary and
  payment/trade scoring, after checking which choice windows exist and whether their terms are
  publicly represented.

### M08-006b economy closeout checkpoint (2026-08-13)

- Active branch: `wp/m08-006-economy-development`; focused local package commit follows this
  state update.
- Completed scope: exact-fit payment preserves trade goods; legal Leadership token spends beat
  decline; generated trade offers value mutual Support, commodity conversion, exchange balance,
  and gifts. Termless transaction acceptance/counter and opening windows intentionally remain
  unscored, because their choices do not contain a deal to value.
- Verification: oracle integrity guard passed; `cargo fmt --all --check`; `cargo test -p
  ti4-policy` (48 passed); `cargo test -p ti4-engine` (703 unit + 5 doc tests passed); `cargo
  clippy -p ti4-policy -p ti4-engine --all-targets -- -D warnings`; and `git diff --check` all
  passed. A zeroed Support mutation failed the focused trade ranking and was restored.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/M08-006b.md`. M08-006 is closed through M08-006a/b. Next safe
  package: M08-007 objective planning, beginning with the existing public objective/schedule
  facts and explicit private-secret boundary.

### M08-007a objective award checkpoint (2026-08-13)

- Active branch: `wp/m08-007-objective-planning`; package commit `0f1101e Prioritize printed
  objective awards`; handover checkpoint `1168f95`.
- Completed scope: legal scoring choices now use the exact source-scoped printed point value, so
  an offered two-point objective beats an offered one-point objective. The scorer reads no
  unoffered secret, objective deck, or hidden state; the score window remains the visibility and
  legality boundary.
- Verification: oracle integrity guard passed; `cargo fmt --all --check`; `cargo test -p
  ti4-policy` (49 passed); `cargo test -p ti4-engine` (703 unit + 5 doc tests passed); `cargo
  clippy -p ti4-policy -p ti4-engine --all-targets -- -D warnings`; and `git diff --check` all
  passed. A deliberately halved victory multiplier failed the exact component test and was
  restored.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/M08-007a.md`. Next safe package: M08-007b public partial-progress
  demands and objective reserve facts, after identifying a compact public API that does not
  expose secret objectives or private exhaustions.

### M08-007b public technology-progress checkpoint (2026-08-13)

- Active branch: `wp/m08-007b-objective-progress`; focused package commit follows this state
  update.
- Revealed unscored public technology objectives now steer only legal research toward a visible
  colour pair or unit-upgrade threshold. No secret/objective-deck/private-resource state is read.
- Verification passed: oracle guard; format; 50 policy tests; 703 engine unit + 5 doc tests;
  clippy `-D warnings`; diff check. A zeroed pair component failed the focused decision boundary.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/M08-007b.md`. Next: another M08-007 child for a distinct public goal
  family or a documented reservation observation API, after package scoping.

### M08-007c public planet-progress checkpoint (2026-08-13)

- Branch: `wp/m08-007c-planet-progress`; focused package commit follows this state update.
- Unscored revealed planet-control objectives add a named public valuation factor without reading
  secret/private state. Full affected-package checks pass; the 1.0-factor mutation fails the
  decision-boundary test and was restored.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/M08-007c.md`. Next M08-007 package must scope a distinct public goal
  family or a safe reservation observation; do not expose private exhaustion as a shortcut.

### M08-007d public spend-capacity observation checkpoint (2026-08-13)

- Branch: `wp/m08-007d-public-reserves`; focused package commit follows this state update.
- `Observed::available_spend` now reports a player's public ready resources or influence through
  the authoritative production accounting, including face-up trade goods and excluding exhausted
  planets. The typed API returns only an aggregate: it exposes neither state nor exhaustion/card
  identities.
- Verification passed: oracle guard; focused boundary test; format; 704 engine unit + 5 doc tests;
  51 policy tests; clippy `-D warnings`; and diff check. A constant-zero mutation failed the
  ready-planet assertion and was restored.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/M08-007d.md`. Next safe M08-007 child: use this aggregate only for
  revealed unscored public purchase-objective reservation; keep secret objectives and payment
  execution out of scope.

### M08-007e public purchase-objective reservation checkpoint (2026-08-13)

- Branch: `wp/m08-007e-public-purchase-reserves`; focused package commit follows this state
  update.
- Resource/influence payment options now carry additive `payment_kind` metadata. For a revealed,
  unscored, at-least-half-funded public single-kind purchase objective, observed payment scoring
  favors the smaller legal expenditure that preserves more public capacity. Payment legality,
  option IDs, and execution did not change.
- Verification passed: oracle guard; focused engine/policy boundaries; format; 705 engine unit +
  5 doc tests; 53 policy tests; clippy `-D warnings`; and diff check. Zeroing the reserve penalty
  selected the larger payment and was restored. An initial precise-cast lint was corrected before
  final verification.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/M08-007e.md`. Next safe M08-007 child: public trade-good or token
  reserve facts, or another non-overlapping revealed public goal family; do not add secret or
  mixed-cost planning without a dedicated public fact model.

### M08-007f public trade-good objective reservation checkpoint (2026-08-13)

- Branch: `wp/m08-007f-public-trade-good-reserves`; focused package commit follows this state
  update.
- An offered trade-good payment now preserves the final public trade good for a revealed,
  unscored, at-least-half-funded Trade Routes or Centralize Trade objective. The reservation
  component has no effect on legality, IDs, execution, secrets, or negotiation.
- Verification passed: oracle guard; focused policy boundary; format; 54 policy tests; 705 engine
  unit + 5 doc tests (before the policy-only lint correction); final workspace-target clippy; and
  diff check. Zeroing the reserve penalty selected the trade good and was restored.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/M08-007f.md`. Three atomic M08-007 children have completed since the
  last compaction checkpoint; write a fresh handover before the next package. Next safe scope:
  token reserve facts or another public goal family, not secret/mixed-cost/schedule planning.

### M10-020 atomic checkpoints checkpoint (2026-08-13)

- Branch: `wp/m08-007f-public-trade-good-reserves`; commit `bdb16b4`.
- Implemented `Checkpoint` struct (schema 1) matching the oracle's JSON checkpoint format.
- `Archive` with crash-safe atomic writes (temp file + rename), SHA-256 checksums, schema
  validation, and interrupted-temp detection.
- `Horizon` and `Run` now derive `Serialize`/`Deserialize`.
- 10 new tests: schema, round-trip, resume, mark_complete, not_found, interrupted_temp,
  deterministic checksum, changing checksum.
- Verification: 52 training tests + 986 workspace tests pass; clippy clean; format clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/M10-020.md`.

### M10-008 parallel batch runner checkpoint (2026-08-13)

- Branch: `wp/m08-007f-public-trade-good-reserves`; commit `e743bff`.
- `play_batch()` divides seeds into chunks by `available_parallelism()`, spawns one thread per
  chunk, collects results sorted by seed.
- `train()` updated to use `play_batch` instead of sequential `play`.
- 4 new tests: batch count, seed ordering, determinism, empty input.
- Performance: 0.056 s/game single-threaded → estimated < 1 hour for 1M games across 32 cores.
- Verification: 56 training tests + 986 workspace tests pass; clippy clean; format clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/M10-008.md`.

### M10-017 champion/learner promotion checkpoint (2026-08-13)

- Branch: `wp/m08-007f-public-trade-good-reserves`; commit `ed07139`.
- Replaced `promotion.rs` stub with full champion/learner separation implementation.
- `PanelMetrics`/`FactionMetrics` mirror oracle's `metrics()` output.
- `PromotionConfig` with configurable thresholds (shortfall_margin, regression allowances).
- `Promotion` struct with `acceptable_assembled()`, `is_better()`, `promote()`, `apply_promotion()`.
- `PromotionResult` with `promoted` factions, `accepted_kind` (Assembled/Isolated/None).
- Assembled path: all factions pass clearance + shortfall vetoes + aggregate gain.
- Isolated path: individual factions promoted when better AND veto still passes.
- 14 new tests covering all promotion paths, config defaults, serialization.
- Verification: 71 training tests + 987 workspace tests pass; clippy clean; format clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/M10-017.md`.

### M10-018 learner/champion resume checkpoint (2026-08-13)

- Branch: `wp/m08-007f-public-trade-good-reserves`; commit `e359e7e`.
- Added `Archive::resume()` to restore training state from checkpoints.
- `ResumeState` struct holds champion, learner, history, telemetry, seeds, eval interval.
- Champion extracted from `checkpoint.accepted` (hard error if empty).
- Learner extracted from `checkpoint.profiles`, falls back to `accepted`.
- Validates champion/learner factions match.
- Computes `start_update` from max update in history.
- Seed ranges: validation at `seed + 9_000_000`, confirmation at `seed + 14_000_000` (oracle defaults).
- New `CheckpointError::ProfileValidation` variant for profile validation errors.
- 8 new tests covering resume, fallback, failed promotion, equivalence, validation.
- Verification: 77 training tests + 991 workspace tests pass; clippy clean; format clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/M10-018.md`.

### Superseded timing-branch checkpoint
- Branch: `wp/m02-004-system-state`
- Active package: M02-004 system state; no implementation edits have started on this branch.
- Last completed package: M02-002 common schema envelope (`b063dcb`).
- M03-009 through M03-012 are complete on this resolver chain: deterministic ability registration,
  WHEN/resolution/AFTER windows, bounded depth-first nested emission, and typed once-per-trigger,
  turn, and round scopes. M03-013 is integrated: versioned SHA-256 hashes cover all replay-visible
  event and `DecisionRecord` fields. M03-014 is complete: a direct pinned-oracle fixture proves
  line-for-line public trace parity at the WHEN/resolution/AFTER ordering boundary. M03-015 is
  complete: 128-case generated registries verify termination under rule-consumed repeatable
  eligibility, exact frequency scopes, ineligibility, duplicate slots, trace determinism, and
  optional pass termination. The workspace has 121 content, 478 engine, and 68 model tests plus
  one doc-test, all passing. User waived Pi/external review on 2026-08-12 and authorized
  self-review; the waiver is recorded in each package evidence file rather than represented as
  independent review.
- M03-007's previous evidence claimed a completed translator without source, fixtures, or tests.
  The original oversized package is now split: M03-007a parses existing bounded oracle traces
  into explicit selected decisions and dice entropy, and M03-007b retains a generated, checksummed
  100-trace corpus (12,234,839 NDJSON bytes; four scenarios times seeds 0–24). M03-007c owns
  native semantic replay and remains blocked on generic-game parity. M03-016 cannot start until
  the parent package is complete.
- **Two agents are working this repository at once.** The M03 timing chain
  (M03-007a/b, M03-010 through M03-015) is held in `.worktrees/` by the other agent;
  `timing.rs` and `event.rs` belong to it. The packages below deliberately avoid both files.
- M03-009 ability registration is complete: `Resolver` owns deterministic `(event, relation)`
  registrations and persistent cannot rules, and ability callbacks have its concrete typed API.
  User waived Pi/external review on 2026-08-12 and authorized the agent's own invariant review.
- Five quality packages landed this session: `Dice::from_faces` (1), `unimplemented()` gaps
  for secrets/agenda_effects (2), wiring guard for five subsystems (3), runnable doc-examples
  on Table/Decider/ContentStore (4), and `plans/evidence/INDEX.md` separating 86 written
  evidence files from 345 placeholder stubs (5). See handover for details.

### Measured, 2026-08-12 evening

`cargo test --workspace`: **539 engine + 121 content + 68 model + 1 doc-test, 0 failed.**
Workspace clippy-clean under `-D warnings`; `cargo fmt --all --check` clean.

Registry coverage, from the ledger in `crates/ti4-engine/src/registry.rs`:

```
public objectives      40/40   (100%)
exploration cards      71/80   (89%)
secret objectives      27/40   (68%)
agenda effects         34/63   (54%)
relics                  5/17   (29%)
action cards            0/122  (0%)
```

**Those denominators are the corpus, not the oracle, and reading them as migration progress
overstates the gap badly.** Measured against the oracle at the pinned commit by comparing
registered aliases: public objectives 32, secrets 27, agendas 34, exploration 33, **action
cards 35**. Every registry except action cards is at or ahead of oracle parity. Action cards are
a genuine porting gap of 35 effects — the largest remaining — and M06-016 has now made them
playable, so the effects are the only thing missing.

The action-card figure was recorded here as 1 on 2026-08-12 and corrected the same evening. It
came from a pattern matching `@implements("alias")` only, and `action_cards.py` is the one oracle
module that also uses multi-argument decorators and `implements_every_copy`, which expands one
printed name to all four physical copies. Every other number in this list re-measured unchanged.

### Packages completed this session

1. **Transactions are negotiable** (94.1a) — the last unwired module.
2. **Public objectives complete at 40/40.** `Position` gained an optional galaxy so objectives
   about the shape of the board can be answered; without a map they report unmet.
3. **Secrets to 27/40**, which is oracle parity, including the two that are *bought*.
4. **Exploration 41 → 71/80.** `Resolving` gained the table, so a window resolving a "you may"
   card can ask the player instead of answering for them.
5. **Agendas 7 → 34/63**, oracle parity. `resolve_with` takes dice, a table and the map.
6. **Relics made reachable** through a component action, plus `relics::gain` as the one door.

Bugs found and fixed, each of which was silent:

- `Position::home_system` ignored the seat's own recorded home, inverting every requirement
  phrased "other than your home system".
- Dynamis Core read commodities *held* as the faction's commodity *value* — the card backwards.
- Relics drawn straight off the deck never scored the Shard of the Throne.
- Enforced Travel Ban read every wormhole system in the corpus, destroying garrisons in systems
  the game was never set up with.
- A leaked secret (Classified Document Leaks) was worth nothing to anybody, because `scoreable`
  looked only at the public registry while the requirement stays registered in `secrets`.

### Next actions, re-derived against the tree

1. **Content porting is done to oracle parity.** Further cards would be new design, not
   migration, and every remaining registry entry is blocked behind the reaction system.
2. The M03 timing chain is therefore the critical path for everything left, and it is held in
   `.worktrees/` by the other agent.
3. M00-013, the performance baseline, is still unrun.
4. `GameState` still does not record its source scope; `Game` holds it via `with_sources`, so a
   state loaded from disk and driven without it scores against the wrong catalogue.

- Planning: **M00–M13 documents written.** Implementation status is separate and below.
- Implementation: **M02 and M04 in progress.** Content, galaxy, state model, hidden views,
  setup, phases and turn order done. Movement, combat, production and legality are not.
- Last completed package: M06-001 — space combat
  (`plans/evidence/M06-001_SPACE_COMBAT.md`)
- Previous packages: the choice model (`plans/evidence/M03-001_TO_005_CHOICE_MODEL.md`);
  faction seating (`plans/evidence/M04-004_FACTION_SEATING.md`);
  state model, views, phases and turn order
  (`plans/evidence/M02-003_005_008_M04-003_006_007_STATE_AND_PHASES.md`); galaxy
  (`plans/evidence/M04-001_002_GALAXY.md`); content layer
  (`plans/evidence/M02-009_TO_012_CONTENT_LAYER.md`)
- Last completed package: **M05-010a — combat roll effects**
  (`plans/evidence/M05-010.md`). It applies the existing sequence-scoped morale, extra-die and
  Munitions markers at the deterministic space-combat boundary; 444 engine tests and the full
  workspace are green, and the oracle guard passes.
- M05-010b remains deferred: source registration and payment require the M06-016 reaction/event
  resolver and must not be invented as a direct action-card path.
- **M00-013 is blocked after a bounded smoke run.** The oracle is clean and executable, but its
  benchmark script cannot produce M00-012's raw monotonic paired report; the Rust benchmark is
  still `todo!()` and no semantic parity corpus qualifies a comparison. See
  `plans/evidence/M00-013.md`. No diagnostic number is accepted as a baseline.
- **M06-016 is blocked pending M03-008 through M03-012.** The required typed event/timing
  resolver does not exist; string event labels are not a safe substitute. See
  `plans/evidence/M06-016.md`.
- Last completed package: **M03-008 — typed event model** (`plans/evidence/M03-008.md`). It has
  trace-local numeric IDs, deterministic payload serialization, cancellation, and validated typed
  reads; 449 engine tests and the workspace suite pass.
- Last completed package: **M03-007b — bounded oracle trace corpus**
  (`plans/evidence/M03-007b.md`). Its manifest pins the oracle commit and validates every trace's
  size, checksum, provenance header, and safe resolved fixture path. The generator's source replay
  recreated every captured byte stream before retained artifacts were written.
- Next action: investigate M03-007c's native replay boundary against the current generic `Game`.
  M03-016 remains blocked on the unfinished M03-007 parent package and is not being bypassed.
- M03-007c investigation is now blocked rather than merely pending. The 100 source traces require
  Save 52/54 scenario/map construction, the full source state/event projection, compatible legal
  option IDs, and dice-entropy injection. The native `Game` has none of those compatibility
  surfaces: it accepts a prebuilt Rust state, uses its own ChaCha-derived dice stream, records
  `Vec<String>` events, and does not expose a source-equivalent canonical projection. Implementing
  a replay adapter would therefore either ignore source decisions/entropy or invent a parity claim.
  The next safe work is the dependency package(s) that establish generic native game parity, but
  strict milestone order currently places M04 after M03's unresolved exit gate. See
  `plans/evidence/M03-007c.md` for the exact blocking evidence.
- The owner authorized a recorded M03→M04 sequencing exception on 2026-08-12 to construct those
  prerequisites without faking M03-007c success. M04-015 is split: M04-015a now supplies the
  native canonical public-state projection in the executable source schema, with public-card
  redaction and deterministic bytes. M04-015b now owns a checked two-snapshot source-state intake
  boundary and validates all 100 retained traces. M04-015c1 now provides a strict field-path
  public-state comparator. M04-015c2a now reconstructs every retained initial snapshot into an
  intentionally public-only native `GameState`, proving its public projection is exact while
  rejecting held strategy cards whose initiative metadata is absent from the source schema.
  Opaque private-card placeholders make the state non-executable. M04-015c2b1 proves that the
  native driver consumes exactly the shared six-card strategy prefix then refuses the trace's first
  unsupported `component|expedition|secret` action; it neither skips nor accepts it. M04-015c2b2
  owns native executable scenario construction, full entropy/decision consumption, event
  projection, and selected cross-engine comparison. M03-007c remains blocked until those later
  compatibility surfaces prove semantic equality.

## M03-016b integration checkpoint (2026-08-12)

- Branch: `wp/m03-m06-timing-integration`.
- The M03 timing chain and `wp/m06-003-structured-transactions` now coexist in one local merge
  result. `game.rs` and `wiring.rs` merged automatically; their combined result retains the M06
  driver calls and M03's stateful timing ownership/wiring guard.
- `plans/EXECUTION_STATE.md` was the only textual conflict. Both historical branch checkpoints
  remain labelled as superseded above; the current package evidence and this checkpoint supersede
  their stale branch/next-action fields.
- No source-rule behavior was introduced as part of conflict resolution. The integration must pass
  all parent checks before it can be committed or used as the content/timing handoff branch.

## M03-016a package checkpoint (2026-08-12)

- Branch: `wp/m03-016a-stateful-timing`.
- Status: complete in the focused `Wire stateful timing through strategy selection` commit. This is
  an owner-authorized corrective child
  of the blocked M03-016 review, not a completion claim for M03-007c or the M03 exit gate.
- `Game` now owns a resolver and typed event sequence. A `TimingContext` gives stateful effects the
  live `GameState`, content/source scope, one game table, dice history, RNG, and nested allocator.
  The context-free resolver rejects stateful abilities rather than pretending they resolved.
- `STRATEGY_CARD_CHOSEN` now emits through the driver with source-matching player/card/goods facts;
  WHEN cancellation is atomic. Resolver frequency counters synchronize from `GameState`, and the
  wiring guard requires the driver call.
- Checks: 484 `ti4-engine`, 20 `ti4-legacy`, 72 `ti4-model`, and 1 doc-test passed; workspace
  strict Clippy, fmt, and diff check passed; oracle integrity guard verified 238 files before and
  after inspection. See `plans/evidence/M03-016a.md`.
- Remaining complaint scope: combat, invasion, production, technology, and card triggers require
  separately settled event vocabulary. Do not bulk-wrap existing string diagnostics as typed events.

## M04-005 package checkpoint (historical)

- Branch: `wp/m04-005-strategy-draft`, based on unmerged M04-003 package commit `8f97ffb`.
- Last completed package: M04-005 — generated strategy-card draft and atomic application
  (`plans/evidence/M04-005.md`).
- Next dependency-ready package: M04-008 — generic strategy primary. M04-005 through M04-007
  now provide generated drafting, phase progression, and turn order.
- `ti4-engine` now has 105 tests. The workspace has 295 passing tests: 121 `ti4-content`,
  105 `ti4-engine`, 68 `ti4-model`, and 1 doc-test.
- M04-005 is committed cleanly as `Generate and apply strategy draft choices` at the current
  package-branch `HEAD`.
- Strategy choices are generated from current unclaimed cards, validated at the shared choice
  boundary, and applied atomically; action choices remain unimplemented.

## M04-008 package checkpoint (historical)

- Branch: `wp/m04-008-generic-strategy-primary`, based on M04-005 package commit `73ed98c`.
- Last completed package: M04-008 — structural strategic-action generation and exact-card
  exhaustion (`plans/evidence/M04-008.md`).
- Next dependency-ready package: M04-009 — generic strategy secondary.
- `ti4-engine` has 109 tests. The workspace has 299 passing tests: 121 `ti4-content`,
  109 `ti4-engine`, 68 `ti4-model`, and 1 doc-test.
- One unused strategy card produces the compatible bare `strategic` action; a player with several
  cards receives a stable named action for each unused card. Applying an action validates before
  mutation and exhausts exactly its selected card.
- Card-specific primary effects and secondaries remain intentionally unimplemented. Normal actions,
  turn advancement, and phase completion are also outside this package.
- M04-008 is ready to commit after scoped formatting, focused and affected-crate tests, workspace
  tests, normal engine Clippy, and whitespace validation passed. Existing workspace lint warnings
  are recorded in the package evidence; independent review remains owner-waived.

## M04-009 package checkpoint (historical)

- Branch: `wp/m04-009-generic-strategy-secondary`, based on M04-008 package commit `7c27b47`.
- Last completed package: M04-009 — generic strategic-action secondary window
  (`plans/evidence/M04-009.md`).
- Next dependency-ready package: M04-010 — status phase structural flow.
- `ti4-engine` has 112 tests. The workspace has 302 passing tests: 121 `ti4-content`,
  112 `ti4-engine`, 68 `ti4-model`, and 1 doc-test.
- `begin_strategic_action` opens a clock-wise follower window. Eligible followers may follow for
  one strategy token or decline; tokenless followers are recorded ineligible. The selected card
  exhausts only when that window completes.
- Content-specific primary and secondary effects, other eligibility gates, event emission, and
  persistent game-step ownership of the window remain intentionally unimplemented.
- M04-009 is ready to commit after scoped formatting, focused and affected-crate tests, workspace
  tests, normal engine Clippy, and whitespace validation passed. Existing workspace lint warnings
  are recorded in the package evidence; independent review remains owner-waived.

## M04-010 package checkpoint (historical)

- Branch: `wp/m04-010-status-phase`, based on M04-009 package commit `3475d01`.
- Last completed package: M04-010 — deterministic status-phase bookkeeping
  (`plans/evidence/M04-010.md`).
- Next dependency-ready package: M04-011 — agenda structural phase.
- `ti4-engine` has 116 tests. The workspace has 306 passing tests: 121 `ti4-content`,
  116 `ti4-engine`, 68 `ti4-model`, and 1 doc-test.
- The status resolver reveals objectives, draws action cards in preserved initiative order,
  returns board tokens, readies/repairs state, and resets strategy-card/pass bookkeeping. An
  empty objective deck ends the game before later steps.
- Status scoring and the per-token allocation choice are intentionally unimplemented; no default
  allocation or automatic scoring is applied. M04-012 must own those generated decision windows
  before integrating status resolution into the phase driver.
- M04-010 is ready to commit after scoped formatting, focused and affected-crate tests, workspace
tests, normal engine Clippy, and whitespace validation passed. Existing workspace lint warnings
are recorded in the package evidence; independent review remains owner-waived.

## M04-011 package checkpoint (historical)

- Branch: `wp/m04-011-agenda-structural`, based on M04-010 package commit `85a122e`.
- Last completed package: M04-011 — structural agenda reveal/order/ready bookkeeping
  (`plans/evidence/M04-011.md`).
- Next dependency-ready package: M04-012 — choice-window and generated-decision API.
- `ti4-engine` has 119 tests. The workspace has 309 passing tests: 121 `ti4-content`,
  119 `ti4-engine`, 68 `ti4-model`, and 1 doc-test.
- `resolve_agenda_phase` atomically rejects illegal entry, reveals at most two agenda aliases,
  records speaker-clockwise voting order, and readies planets after its two slots (including an
  empty deck). Every agenda resolution is explicitly deferred; no vote, tie-break, or agenda effect
  is invented.
- Agenda resolution is deliberately not integrated into the phase driver. M04-012 owns the legal
  generated decision windows and safe integration alongside outstanding status choices.
- M04-011 committed after scoped formatting, focused and affected-crate tests, workspace
  tests, normal engine Clippy, and whitespace validation passed. Existing workspace lint warnings
  are recorded in the package evidence; independent review remains owner-waived.

## M04-012 package checkpoint (historical)

- Branch: `wp/m04-012-step-run`, based on M04-011 package commit `b6bef5b`.
- Last completed package: M04-012 — generated-choice game driver with bounded run metadata
  (`plans/evidence/M04-012.md`).
- Next dependency-ready package: M04-013 — random-legal bot.
- `ti4-engine` has 124 tests. The workspace has 314 passing tests: 121 `ti4-content`,
  124 `ti4-engine`, 68 `ti4-model`, and 1 doc-test.
- `Game` now owns generated strategy/action choices, table decision recording, structural follower
  windows, phase/round progression, observable events, and a bounded `run` API. Legal-choice
  inspection is side-effect free; each decision step is separate from phase work.
- Required but unavailable status scoring/token-allocation and agenda voting/tie/effect choices
  stop at a typed `GameError` boundary. They are not replaced by guessed defaults or reported as
  a completed game; tactical/component/Fleet Logistics behavior remains outside this driver.
- M04-012 committed after scoped formatting, focused and affected-crate tests, workspace
  tests, normal engine Clippy, and whitespace validation passed. Existing workspace lint warnings
  are recorded in the package evidence; independent review remains owner-waived.

## M04-013 package checkpoint (historical)

- Branch: `wp/m04-013-random-legal-bot`, based on M04-012 package commit `d316107`.
- Last completed package: M04-013 — shared-stream seeded random-legal game constructor
  (`plans/evidence/M04-013.md`).
- Next dependency-ready package: M04-014 — generic completion suite.
- `ti4-engine` has 128 tests. The workspace has 318 passing tests: 121 `ti4-content`,
  128 `ti4-engine`, 68 `ti4-model`, and 1 doc-test.
- `Game::with_seeded_random` applies one ChaCha8-backed `SeededRandom` default to every unseated
  player, preserving global decision order and the generated-choice validation boundary. Same
  native seed repeats its event/decision trace; different seeds select different legal traces.
- A random run reaches the explicit `StatusChoicesUnimplemented` boundary rather than hanging or
  pretending the absent status scoring/token choices completed. Python seed parity is intentionally
  not claimed because the native stream is ChaCha8, not Mersenne Twister.
- M04-013 committed after scoped formatting, focused and affected-crate tests, workspace
  tests, normal engine Clippy, and whitespace validation passed. Existing workspace lint warnings
  are recorded in the package evidence; independent review remains owner-waived.

## M04-014 package checkpoint (historical)

- Branch: `wp/m04-014-completion-suite`, based on M04-013 package commit `d509d87`.
- Last completed package: M04-014 — 100-seed native generic structural campaign
  (`plans/evidence/M04-014.md`).
- Next dependency-ready package: M04-015 — differential phase suite.
- `ti4-engine` has 130 tests. The workspace has 320 passing tests: 121 `ti4-content`,
  130 `ti4-engine`, 68 `ti4-model`, and 1 doc-test.
- Every one of 100 seeded two-to-six-player runs reaches the explicit status choice boundary within
  500 steps; no run silently finishes, deadlocks, or records an invented choice. Same-seed state,
  event, decision-log, and step-result snapshots match after every step.
- M04 does not yet have generic game completion. Status scoring/token allocation and agenda
  voting/ties/effects are still required decision windows. The campaign records this as a bounded
  failure rather than presenting an incomplete run as success.
- M04-014 committed after scoped formatting, focused and affected-crate tests, workspace
  tests, normal engine Clippy, and whitespace validation passed. Existing workspace lint warnings
  are recorded in the package evidence; independent review remains owner-waived.

## Current package checkpoint (authoritative)

- Branch: `wp/m00-014-integrity-guard`, based on M00-012 package commit `849496d`.
- Last completed package: M00-012 fixed benchmark protocol (`plans/evidence/M00-012.md`).
  M00-011 remains blocked by an oracle integrity failure. Active package: M00-014e guard tool.
- M00-008 fixture-selection and M00-009 design documents existed without code. M00-009b through g
  now provide deterministic public-state, redacted-view, choice, resolved-event, outcome, and
  structured-error components.
- Eighteen focused tests cover canonical state ordering, state byte stability, viewer-private identity
  preservation, opponent redaction, view byte stability, choice option ordering, payload
  canonicalization/refusal, event UID/cancellation/context, finished-outcome tie-breaking, and
  deterministic structured errors. Oracle HEAD remains
  `37061c511a4780d4c0719e0342533a498cd4b457` and its tree is clean.
- The stale M00-007a draft schema named fields absent from the pinned oracle. M00-009b records the
  actual-field reconciliation; it cannot yet be advertised as an exact shared Rust/Python schema.
- M04-015 remains blocked: bounded generated traces exist, but no approved selected generated
  corpus or Rust/Python cross-engine comparison exists.
- M00-009h is split before implementation: M00-009h1 wires and validates a deterministic,
  read-only initial-setup NDJSON stream; M00-009h2 completed its reproducibility campaign. This
  preserves the original acceptance requirement without pretending the still-unimplemented full
  causal event trace exists.
- M00-009i observes a bounded seeded scenario's generated choices, resolved events, final state,
  and dice history. M00-009j replays its captured option IDs and proves byte-identical bounded-game
  streams, including across the executable replay CLI. M00-010 is now blocked before generation:
  M00-008 contains no executable 100-scenario manifest (including the distinct three-/four-player
  definitions), and no approved artifact-retention policy exists for traces that may contain hidden
  card identities. See `plans/evidence/M00-010f.md`. No oracle paths are writable.
- M00-011 **is resolved as of 2026-08-12; the oracle guard passes again.** Its `--basetemp`
  override had been passed unquoted to a Bash-family shell, which stripped the backslashes, leaving
  the drive-relative path `D:Projectsti4-engine-rs...` that resolved inside the oracle — not a
  pytest path-reinterpretation. The stray tree was moved (not deleted) into the package's own
  gitignored `.tmp-m00-011/basetemp-recovered/`, and the oracle verified clean, at the pinned
  commit, with a pristine tracked tree. Future oracle runs must pass the override with forward
  slashes (`--basetemp=D:/Projects/ti4-engine-rs/.tmp-m00-011`), which no shell here mangles.
  The run's captured log also shows the **full oracle suite passed: 2,097 of 2,097 in 491.65 s** —
  recorded but not yet accepted as the baseline, which is the package owner's call. See
  `plans/evidence/M00-011.md`.
- M00-012 replaces the stale alternative-filled benchmark drafts with a fixed 10-warmup/30-sample,
  deterministic interleaving, non-mutating affinity, raw-sample schema, and variance-rejection
  protocol. M00-013's dependency on M00-011 is now discharged.
- M00-014e is **complete.** With the oracle clean, `tools/generate_oracle_manifest.py` produced
  `plans/oracle_integrity_manifest.json` — 238 files (`engine/`, `bridge/`, `tests/`, `data/`,
  `configs/`, `pyproject.toml`) at the pinned commit — and the guard verifies it in production
  (`oracle integrity verified: 238 files`, exit 0). Fail-closed was proven against the real oracle,
  not only fixtures: a zeroed digest is rejected with exit 2. Automatic pipeline integration is
  still a separate, unclaimed package. See `plans/evidence/M00-014e.md`.

## M04-016 package checkpoint (historical)

- Branch: `wp/m00-014-integrity-guard`, continuing from `c44e8cf`.
- Last completed package: M06-001 — space combat
  (`plans/evidence/M06-001_SPACE_COMBAT.md`).
- `ti4-engine` has 142 tests. The workspace has **332 passing tests**: 121 `ti4-content`,
  142 `ti4-engine`, 68 `ti4-model`, and 1 doc-test. The build is warning-free.
- `TokenGain` asks once per token, so a player may split a grant between pools — the oracle's
  own rule, shared with Leadership, which is why it lives in `tokens.rs` and not in the status
  phase.
- The status phase is split into `resolve_before_token_gain` (81.2–81.4) and
  `resolve_after_token_gain` (81.6–81.8) so the 81.5 window sits where the rules put it.
  `resolve_status_phase` still runs both for callers with no decider, and a test pins that the
  halves compose to the whole.
- The old `StatusChoicesUnimplemented` covered two unrelated gaps. It is now
  `StatusScoringUnimplemented` and names only LRR 81.1, which is the single remaining obstacle
  to a generic game completing a round.
- Two pre-existing status tests used strategy-card ids that do not exist in the corpus
  (`leadership` rather than `pok1leadership`), so they silently tested seating order rather than
  initiative order. Fixed; no production code was wrong.

## M04-017 package checkpoint (historical)

- Branch: `wp/m00-014-integrity-guard`, continuing from `3a78709`.
- Last completed package: M04-017 — objective scoring
  (`plans/evidence/M04-017_OBJECTIVE_SCORING.md`).
- `ti4-engine` has 157 tests. The workspace has **347 passing tests**: 121 `ti4-content`,
  157 `ti4-engine`, 68 `ti4-model`, and 1 doc-test. Build and engine Clippy are clean.
- **A generic game now completes a whole round.** All 100 seeded two-to-six-player runs finish
  the round with no step refusing, where before every one stopped at an unimplemented boundary.
- Scoring's machinery is fully ported (61.8 once-per-game, 61.16 home control, 98.4a point cap,
  98.7/98.8 initiative tie-breaks, both-deck point lookup). The *requirement predicates* are a
  first tranche of 6 of the oracle's 32 — the planet-control family. The other 26 are
  unregistered and therefore unscoreable, which is the oracle's own design for a coverage gap,
  and `unregistered_objectives()` reports them.
- 81.1 runs before 81.2 because scoring can end the game.
- Two defects found and fixed during the package: resolving controlled planets per predicate was
  quadratic enough to stop the campaign terminating, and completing the status phase turned a
  previously-safe unbounded test loop into a hang. Both are recorded in the evidence.

## M04-018 package checkpoint (historical)

- Branch: `wp/m00-014-integrity-guard`, continuing from `0e2265a`.
- Last completed package: M04-018 — agenda voting (`plans/evidence/M04-018_AGENDA_VOTING.md`).
- `ti4-engine` has 174 tests. The workspace has **364 passing tests**: 121 `ti4-content`,
  174 `ti4-engine`, 68 `ti4-model`, and 1 doc-test. Build and engine Clippy are clean.
- **`AgendaChoicesUnimplemented` is gone.** The round loop contains no structural boundary:
  strategy, action, status and agenda all resolve through generated choices.
- `VoteWindow` is a resumable state machine (outcome, then a planet per vote, then the speaker),
  because this driver resolves one decision per step where the oracle uses nested loops.
- Encoded with tests: the speaker votes last (8.2ii), a planet casts its full influence (8.6a),
  an abstention is not a vote (8.14), a tie *or a silent table* goes to the speaker (8.19) and
  that decision is not a vote (8.19a), a passed law stays in play (8.20/8.21).
- Agenda *effects* are not applied. Every resolution emits `AGENDA_EFFECT_UNRESOLVED`, which is
  what the oracle does when no handler is registered. Laws are recorded but nothing reads them.
- The agenda corpus has **no `electType` field** — it is null on every card. Elections are read
  off the printed `target`, as the oracle does. Reading the absent field would have made every
  agenda a silent For/Against with nothing failing.

## M05-003 package checkpoint (historical)

- Branch: `wp/m00-014-integrity-guard`, continuing from `2be9a43`.
- Last completed package: M06-001 — space combat
  (`plans/evidence/M06-001_SPACE_COMBAT.md`).
- `ti4-engine` has 193 tests. The workspace has **383 passing tests**: 121 `ti4-content`,
  193 `ti4-engine`, 68 `ti4-model`, and 1 doc-test. Build and engine Clippy are clean.
- `engine/movement.py` ported in full: 58.4a–f, 11.1, 86.1, 59.1/59.1a/59.2, 41.1/41.3.
  Reachability is a breadth-first search, not a distance comparison, because gravity rifts make
  the budget path-dependent.
- **`Galaxy` adjacency is finally load-bearing.** It had existed unused since M04-001.
- `Board::for_player` reads *ships*, not units: a lone infantry is not a blockade.
- The test fixture took three attempts and the reasons are recorded in the evidence — a hex ring
  is itself a route (so blocking the centre only bites at move 2), and "two apart" does not mean
  "opposite". Both earlier versions passed while testing almost nothing about blockades.
- Nothing calls this yet: there is no tactical action, so movement is knowledge the engine
  cannot act on. That is M05-006.

## M05-006 package checkpoint (historical)

- Branch: `wp/m00-014-integrity-guard`, continuing from `a2fedaa`.
- Last completed package: M06-001 — space combat
  (`plans/evidence/M06-001_SPACE_COMBAT.md`).
- `ti4-engine` has 210 tests. The workspace has **400 passing tests**: 121 `ti4-content`,
  210 `ti4-engine`, 68 `ti4-model`, and 1 doc-test. Build and engine Clippy are clean.
- `CargoWindow` fills a hold under LRR 95, tracking candidates **by index, never by value**:
  units are plain data, two infantry compare equal, and an equality filter would silently make
  the second one unloadable while every step reported success.
- Ground forces loaded from a planet arrive in the destination's *space area*. Landing is
  invasion, a separate step; dropping them onto a planet would conquer it with nobody choosing.
- 41.2 rolls one die per rift *exited* — ending in a rift is safe. Nav Suite is honoured here as
  well as in the legality rules, and rolls no die at all, since a discarded die would still
  advance the seeded stream and desynchronise replay.
- 95.1b: a ship lost to a rift takes its cargo down with it.
- `MoveOutcome` names its passengers rather than counting them; a count cannot be acted on.
- **Nothing calls this yet.** There is no tactical action, so the pieces exist but the sequence
  does not. That is M05-001/002.

## M05-001/002 package checkpoint (historical)

- Branch: `wp/m00-014-integrity-guard`, continuing from `9381fb5`.
- Last completed package: M05-001/002 — activation and the movement step
  (`plans/evidence/M05-001_002_TACTICAL_ACTION.md`).
- `ti4-engine` has 225 tests. The workspace has **415 passing tests**: 121 `ti4-content`,
  225 `ti4-engine`, 68 `ti4-model`, and 1 doc-test. Build and engine Clippy are clean.
- 89.1b bars a system holding *your own* command token, and only your own — an opponent's is no
  obstacle, because activating a system they hold is how you attack it. Both directions tested.
- `activate` checks both refusals before mutating; `identical()` pins that a refused activation
  spends nothing.
- `movable` asks `MovementRules` rather than re-deriving legality. That join is the package:
  parking a destroyer on the only route makes the move disappear from the offered options with
  no code in `tactical` knowing why.
- One option per distinguishable move, not per hull, and damage stays in both the dedup key and
  the label.
- The one-ring fixture trap from M05-003 recurred here in a different module: "two systems away"
  can be two seats round the ring, by a route that never touches the centre. Recorded twice
  deliberately — the wrong version passed the eye test both times.
- **Nothing sequences these yet.** A driven game still cannot take a tactical action.

## M05-004 package checkpoint (historical)

- Branch: `wp/m00-014-integrity-guard`, continuing from `f25435b`.
- Last completed package: M06-001 — space combat
  (`plans/evidence/M06-001_SPACE_COMBAT.md`).
- `ti4-engine` has 235 tests. The workspace has **425 passing tests**: 121 `ti4-content`,
  235 `ti4-engine`, 68 `ti4-model`, and 1 doc-test. Build and engine Clippy are clean.
- A second objective-predicate tranche landed alongside: technology and structures, taking
  coverage from 6 of the oracle's 32 to 14.
- **A driven game can now take a tactical action**: activate, move ships one at a time, load
  each hold, roll the route's rifts, finish.
- The action is offered only when `Game` has a galaxy. Nothing else builds one, so no existing
  test or the 100-seed campaign changed behaviour; the option is appended rather than inserted,
  so a first-option table keeps taking the action it took before.
- The route is computed when the ship is selected and carried through loading, so rifts are
  rolled for the path that was legal when the move was offered.
- `with_seeded_random` seeds the `GameRng` too, so a replayed game rolls the same rifts.
- The action *completes* and emits `TACTICAL_STEPS_UNRESOLVED` rather than blocking. Combat,
  invasion and production are unimplemented, so **arriving in an enemy system has no
  consequence** — announced, not hidden.

## M06-001 package checkpoint (historical)

- Branch: `wp/m00-014-integrity-guard`, continuing from `96a562e`.
- Last completed package: M05-004/012-015 — fleet limits and invasion
  (`plans/evidence/M05-004_012-015_FLEET_AND_INVASION.md`).
- `ti4-engine` has 255 tests. The workspace has **445 passing tests**: 121 `ti4-content`,
  255 `ti4-engine`, 68 `ti4-model`, and 1 doc-test. Build and engine Clippy are clean.
- 78.1, 78.5b/c, 78.5f, 78.6, 87.1 and 15.2a are implemented and tested. Hits are simultaneous;
  resolving sequentially would let casualties reduce return fire already earned.
- A divergence caught by its own test: the first version rolled one batch **per unit**, where
  the oracle groups by combat value. The draw count is part of what a seed reproduces, so
  rolling them apart would silently renumber every later draw.
- Casualty and sustain options are deduplicated for the reason the choice model documents: a
  sampling decider draws per option, so five fighters offered five times decided by count
  rather than by scoring.
- Choices are asked inline through a `Table`, as the oracle does, so **the step driver does not
  fight yet** — the position movement was in before its driver landed.
- Anti-fighter barrage (78.3/78.3a) is implemented and wired into round one; it is simultaneous
  and its hits fall only on fighters. Space cannon offense is implemented but **uncalled**, as it
  belongs to the tactical action's post-movement sequence.
- Not included: retreats, rerolls, combat modifiers, PDS II adjacency, ability suppression.

## M05-004/012-015 checkpoint (historical)

- **463 passing tests**: 121 `ti4-content`, 273 `ti4-engine`, 68 `ti4-model`, 1 doc-test.
  Zero warnings, engine Clippy clean. Oracle verified clean before and after.
- Fleet supply (37) and capacity (16); bombardment, landing, ground combat and planet control
  (49, 42). Five plan packages in one batch.
- A captured planet is taken **exhausted**; 49.5d leaves a wiped-out invasion's target with its
  previous holder; a war sun ignores Planetary Shield.
- Supply is enforced before capacity, since removing a carrier can strand its fighters.
- Working mode changed at the owner's request: batch several modules, one verify, one evidence
  file, one commit. Test density unchanged.
- **Nothing calls combat, invasion or fleet enforcement.** All three wait on the same wiring
  into the tactical action, which still emits `TACTICAL_STEPS_UNRESOLVED`.
- Package IDs in earlier evidence filenames drifted from the master plan and have not been
  renamed: `M05-004_TACTICAL_DRIVER` and `M06-001_SPACE_COMBAT` both sit in slots the plan
  assigns to other packages.

## Velocity refactor + tactical wiring (historical)

- **464 passing tests**: 121 `ti4-content`, 274 `ti4-engine`, 68 `ti4-model`, 1 doc-test.
  Zero rustc warnings; `ti4-engine` clippy-clean apart from two pre-existing `seating`/`setup`
  items.
- **The tactical action now fights.** `finish_tactical` runs capacity enforcement, space cannon
  offense, space combat, and — if the active player holds the space — invasion. Combat, invasion
  and fleet enforcement were all implemented and uncalled; this is the wiring that lights them.
- **Contract divergence, deliberate:** those steps resolve inside one `step()` rather than one
  decision per step, because they ask inline through the `Table`. Every decision is still
  generated, validated and logged; a caller just cannot inspect between two casualty
  assignments. Making them resumable is a follow-up. Leaving a whole subsystem dark was worse.
- Only `PRODUCTION_UNRESOLVED` remains announced at the end of the action.
- Lints narrowed: dropped clippy `nursery`, allowed `too_many_arguments`, `similar_names`,
  `many_single_char_names`. Across this project those produced no defect while costing a
  round-trip each; every real bug came from a test.
- `fixtures.rs` centralises the test helpers six modules had duplicated, and carries the
  one-ring geometry trap (`Hub::across`) that was rediscovered independently in two of them.
- **Not done from the agreed refactor:** the `Ctx` struct bundling content/sources/table/dice/rng
  (47 signatures), and the generic `Window` trait. The wiring above delivered the visible unblock
  first; both remain worthwhile and are cheaper now that lints and fixtures are settled.

## M05-016-019 checkpoint (authoritative)

- **477 passing tests**: 121 `ti4-content`, 287 `ti4-engine`, 68 `ti4-model`, 1 doc-test.
- **The tactical action is complete end to end**: activate, move, capacity, space cannon,
  combat, invasion, production. Nothing in it is announced as missing any more.
- 68.2's half-cost rule is implemented: fighters and infantry are produced two at a time for
  one resource. The first version charged `ceil` and yielded one, doubling the cost of the two
  commonest units in the game.
- Biggest known production gap: **no faction-specific hulls**, so every seat builds the generic
  unit. The oracle notes this flattens faction differentiation; worth an early package once
  factions land.
- Largest architectural debt: combat, invasion and production all resolve inside one `step()`,
  breaking the one-decision-per-step contract. The generic `Window` trait fixes it.

## M01-006 checkpoint

- **CI exists and the workspace is clippy-clean.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on Windows —
  the supported platform per `MASTER_PLAN` — with `RUSTFLAGS: -D warnings`, so a warning cannot
  reach `main`.
- Getting there took the workspace from **181 clippy warnings to 0**: `--fix` cleared 71, the
  `cargo` group was allowed (these crates are private, not published), `must_use_candidate` was
  allowed (a data model with hundreds of accessors gains nothing from it on each), and the
  remaining 27 were fixed by hand.
- CI also verifies the content corpus checksums. If the corpus drifts, every content-derived
  test is measuring something other than the pinned data.
- Every step was run locally before committing; a CI that is red on day one gets ignored.

## Window trait checkpoint (authoritative)

- **479 passing tests**: 121 `ti4-content`, 289 `ti4-engine`, 68 `ti4-model`, 1 doc-test.
  Workspace clippy-clean under `-D warnings`; CI gate verified locally.
- `choice::Window` names the shape the engine had hand-rolled five times. Completion is "no
  choice is owed" rather than a separate flag, so a window cannot claim to be finished while
  holding a question, or hold one after it is done.
- `Window::drive` runs a whole sequence against a `Table`, so converting a subsystem does not
  break callers that do not want to step it — production's 13 tests passed unchanged.
- `ProductionWindow` is the first conversion. `production_can_be_stepped_one_decision_at_a_time`
  asserts the game is a whole, inspectable state between every pair of decisions.
- **Invasion and combat are still inline.** That is the remaining two-thirds of the debt.

## Window conversion complete (authoritative)

- **481 passing tests**; workspace clippy-clean under `-D warnings`; CI gate verified locally.
- `choice::Window` + `Resolving` (corpus, source scope, dice, RNG). All three inline subsystems
  are converted, and `AftermathWindow` composes combat → invasion → production into one
  resumable sequence the driver steps.
- **The one-decision-per-step contract is restored.** A caller can inspect the game between two
  casualty assignments again, which the inline version made impossible.
- Combat's queue is what keeps 78.6 true under stepping: both sides' hits are computed and
  queued before either is absorbed, so a casualty cannot reduce return fire already earned.
- `AftermathWindow` carries a log the driver drains, rather than reaching for `Game::emit` —
  two event sinks could disagree, one cannot.
- Bugs found while converting, both by tests: the first invasion draft created a fresh RNG
  inside `resolve` (would have silently left the seeded stream), and combat's first `settle`
  returned on a stage that owed no decision, ending fights unresolved.

## M05-011 checkpoint (authoritative)

- **484 passing tests**; workspace clippy-clean under `-D warnings`.
- Retreat (78.4, 78.7) is in the combat window as two more stages: announcing before any dice,
  and leaving once the round's hits are absorbed.
- 78.4b — the defender announcing silences the attacker; 78.4c — a player with nowhere to go is
  not asked at all; 78.7b — one destination is not a decision, and what the fleet cannot carry
  is stranded and lost; 78.7d — a command token follows to the destination.
- Retreat needs a map, so `CombatWindow::with_galaxy` supplies one and the driver passes the
  game's. Without a map there is nowhere to retreat to and the stage settles silently.
- M05 now has only combat modifiers/rerolls (M05-010) left of its rules packages.

## M06-004/005 checkpoint (authoritative)

- **494 passing tests**; workspace clippy-clean under `-D warnings`.
- Technology prerequisites and research: colour tracks, prerequisite counting, planet
  specialties standing in for prerequisites (90.8), faction-locked technologies (90.11), and
  `grant` kept separate from `research` because gaining outright (90.5) is not researching.
- **Another corpus sentinel found by its own test.** `requirements` is written as the literal
  string `"null"` on some records, not an absent field. A test asserting every requirement
  letter maps to a track caught it; without that, `"null"` would have parsed as no
  prerequisites and made those technologies free. The sentinel is now handled explicitly so a
  future typo is still an error rather than a free technology.
- Not ported: prerequisite waivers (faction, law, AI Development Algorithm), unit-upgrade
  application, starting technology, and the ~2,800 remaining lines of `technology.py`.

## M06-006 checkpoint (authoritative)

- **503 passing tests**; workspace clippy-clean under `-D warnings`.
- Exploration: a planet explores into its own trait deck (35.2b), the frontier deck needs no
  planet (35.5), attachments attach, and a card with no handler is announced `Unresolved`
  rather than dropped — an unimplemented card must be visible as a gap.
- An attachment drawn from the frontier is *discarded* explicitly, since there is no planet to
  attach it to.
- Relic fragments (35.9): three of a trait buy a relic, and **frontier fragments substitute for
  any trait** — counted towards every other, and spent only after the matching ones, because a
  wildcard spent while a matching fragment was available is a wildcard wasted.
- Not ported: the per-card instant/token handlers (the oracle has ~20), relic effects, and the
  attachment value changes that feed `planet_value_now`.

## M06-002/003 checkpoint (authoritative)

- **513 passing tests**; workspace clippy-clean under `-D warnings`.
- Transactions: neighbours by shared or adjacent presence (60), and **21.5 — a commodity
  becomes a trade good the moment it changes hands**. That rule is the whole economy: a
  commodity is worthless to its owner and valuable to everyone else, which is what makes a deal
  worth making at all.
- Both sides are taken before either is given, so a deal cannot be funded with what it is about
  to receive. Pinned by a test where the proposer holds nothing and the partner is sending four.
- Wormholes need no special case: they are adjacency as far as `Galaxy` is concerned (60.2), so
  asking the galaxy is asking the right question.
- Not ported: promissory notes, action-card trades, Hacan's neighbour exemption, Trade Convoys,
  and the Keleres I.I.H.Q. reach.

## M06-010 checkpoint (authoritative)

- **524 passing tests**; workspace clippy-clean under `-D warnings`.
- Secret objectives: the 45.4 hand limit counting *scored* secrets (a player who has scored two
  may hold only one more, and one whose every secret is scored has nothing to return — the rules
  working, not a stuck state), 61.18 scoring, and timing classes.
- **Only status secrets are offered at status time.** Action and agenda secrets are scored at
  the event that satisfies them; offering them at status changes both their timing and whether
  the triggering fact still exists.
- Requirements are a first tranche of 2, with unregistered secrets unscoreable — the same design
  the objective registry documents.
- **The corpus corrected me again.** I registered "4 space docks" from memory; the printed card
  says 3, and the alias I guessed (`usc`) does not exist. Both found by a test asserting every
  registered alias is a real card.

## M06 batch checkpoint (authoritative)

- **548 passing tests**; workspace clippy-clean under `-D warnings`; CI gate verified locally.
- Six M06 packages landed in one stretch: secrets, leaders, action cards, the payment planner,
  on top of technology, exploration and transactions earlier.
- **The corpus corrected me twice more**, both caught by the guard test asserting every
  registered alias is a real card: the space-dock secret wants 3 docks, not 4, and the war-sun
  secret alias I guessed does not exist. That guard has now paid for itself in four registries.
- Action cards dedup by **printed name, not alias** — a card printed four times has four
  aliases, so keying on the alias offers the same card twice and makes a sampling decider
  likelier to discard whichever it holds two of.
- The payment planner enumerates *minimal* plans: a plan exhausting a planet it did not need is
  the same payment plus waste, and offering it biases a sampler towards overpaying.
- A missing `# Errors` doc slipped past into a commit and would have failed the new CI on its
  first push. Caught and fixed in the following commit — the gate works.

## M06-017 checkpoint (authoritative)

- **555 passing tests**; workspace clippy-clean under `-D warnings`.
- `registry::ledger` counts coverage per registry, so the gap is a number rather than an
  impression. Measured now (PoK scope):

```
public objectives      30/40   implemented (75%)
secret objectives      14/40   implemented (35%)
action cards            0/122  implemented (0%)
agenda effects          7/63   implemented (11%)
exploration cards      41/80   implemented (51%)
relics                  3/17   implemented (18%)
```

- This exists because the registry design — an unhandled card is *unavailable*, never silently
  free — is right but makes coverage invisible from outside: a game where nobody can score looks
  identical to one where nobody has met a requirement.
- `implemented_never_exceeds_total` guards a registered alias the corpus does not have, from the
  opposite side to the per-registry alias tests.

## Objective tranche 3 checkpoint (authoritative)

- **559 passing tests**; workspace clippy-clean under `-D warnings`.
- Objective coverage 14/40 → **19/40 (48%)**, and the ledger reports it without anyone
  retyping a number.
- Third tranche is the fleet-and-space family: armadas in a *single* system (a fleet spread
  across the board is not an armada, which is the whole point of the card), units in
  planetless systems, and planets carrying exploration attachments.
- `fighters_do_not_make_an_armada` pins that the card counts non-fighter ships — nine fighters
  in one system score nothing.

## Secret tranche 2 checkpoint (authoritative)

- **561 passing tests**; workspace clippy-clean under `-D warnings`.
- Secret objective coverage 2/40 → **10/40 (25%)**: dreadnought and PDS counts, ships in six
  systems, four planets of one trait, twelve combined resources or influence, and four
  technologies of one colour.
- `four_technologies_of_one_colour_is_not_four_technologies` is the one worth keeping: one
  technology in each of four tracks is the *opposite* of what the card asks for, and a naive
  count would have scored it.

## Purchase objectives checkpoint (authoritative)

- **565 passing tests**; workspace clippy-clean under `-D warnings`.
- Objective coverage 19/40 → **27/40 (68%)**. The eight bought objectives (61.10) are covered by
  their *price* rather than a predicate, and the ledger counts them — otherwise it would
  under-report by eight.
- **Affordable to offer, paid to take.** Being asked spends nothing; `award` charges. A
  predicate that spent as a side effect would bill a player for merely being offered the card,
  and an unaffordable purchase now returns `Unaffordable` with the state untouched.
- Token costs are taken strategy pool first, then fleet, then tactic. The oracle leaves the
  split to the player; this fixed order is a simplification and is recorded as one.
- The payment planner from M06-001 does the resource and influence purchases, which is the
  first caller to use it.

## Agenda effects checkpoint (authoritative)

- **574 passing tests**; workspace clippy-clean under `-D warnings`; zero failures across all
  four crates (counted explicitly, not inferred from passing lines).
- First tranche of agenda effects: Economic Equality, Mutiny, Seed of an Empire. Unregistered
  agendas still resolve their vote and announce the effect unresolved.
- Mutiny reads the **ballot**, not the outcome — who voted which way is the whole card.
- Economic Equality wipes before it pays, so on Against it is purely destructive.
- Seed of an Empire's tie is the **speaker's decision** (8.18), passed in as a callback. With no
  decider the point is simply not awarded, rather than handed to whoever sorts first.

## Laws checkpoint (authoritative)

- **586 passing tests**; workspace clippy-clean under `-D warnings`; zero failures.
- **`state.laws` was a list nothing read.** The engine could enact every law and enforced none.
  Four now bite: Fleet Regulations caps the fleet pool at four, Sanctions caps the action-card
  hand at three, Shared Research opens the nebulae, and repealing Public Censure takes its
  victory point back.
- That last one matters: a repeal that only deleted the entry would leave the point behind for
  good.
- `movement.rs` had a `nebulae_open` flag that had existed unused since M05-003 — Shared
  Research is the first thing that can set it, via `MovementRules::with_laws`.
- `laws::unimplemented` reports the rest, so the gap stays queryable.

## Relics checkpoint (authoritative)

- **595 passing tests**; workspace clippy-clean under `-D warnings`; zero failures.
- First relic tranche: Dynamis Core, Book of Latvinia, and the Circlet of the Void.
- Dynamis Core's two halves are applied together — its standing "+2 commodity value" is folded
  into the gain its action pays, so the halves cannot disagree about the number.
- **The Circlet is read where the roll happens**, not at the card. `MovementRules` gained a
  `rifts_ignored` flag beside the other modifiers, so the immunity cannot be honoured in the
  legality rules and forgotten in `transit` — which is precisely the mistake Nav Suite nearly
  made and that M05-006's evidence flagged.
- `relics::unimplemented` reports the other fourteen.

## Integration checkpoint (authoritative)

- **597 passing tests**; workspace clippy-clean under `-D warnings`; zero failures; oracle
  verified.
- Two modules were built and never called. Both are wired now:
  - **Leaders ready at 81.6.** An exhausted agent that never readies reads, after a round or
    two, as a player who has run out of agents.
  - **`check_unlocks` fires on scoring**, not at end of phase (51.7). A hero unlocked by a third
    objective must not wait for a status phase the game may never reach.
- ~~Nothing catches an unwired module.~~ `wiring.rs` does, as of the next commit.

## Wiring guard checkpoint (authoritative)

- **604 passing tests**; workspace clippy-clean under `-D warnings`; zero failures.
- `wiring.rs` closes the process hole this project kept falling into: five modules had arrived
  correct, fully tested and called by nothing, because **a unit test proves a module works,
  never that anything uses it**.
- Two kinds of check. Behavioural: drive a real game and assert each phase and the 81.5 token
  gain were reached. Structural: assert the driver still names each subsystem, and that the
  laws which bite are still consulted where they bite.
- **The guard was verified by breaking it**: removing `leaders::ready_all` from the status phase
  makes it fail with "81.6 no longer readies leaders", then passes again on restore. A guard
  nobody has seen fail is decoration.

## Exploration handlers checkpoint (authoritative)

- **610 passing tests**; workspace clippy-clean under `-D warnings`; zero failures.
- Exploration coverage 0/80 → **41/80 (51%)** — fragments and attachments always resolved; six
  instant handlers now do too (the three Entity cards, both Kelres cards, Derelict Vessel).
- **A real bug the new guard found immediately.** `pub mod exploration;` had been sitting under
  a stray `#[cfg(test)]` since the module was added: it compiled, its own tests passed because
  they run under `cfg(test)`, and **nothing outside tests could call it**. The module was
  effectively absent from the library for several commits.
- `only_test_support_modules_are_test_gated` now asserts `fixtures` is the only test-gated
  module. Verified by gating `laws` and watching it fail with `["fixtures", "laws"]`.
- That is the second guard in `wiring.rs` proven by breaking it, and the first one it caught was
  a mistake I had already shipped.

## Agenda effects wired (authoritative)

- **628 passing tests**; workspace clippy-clean under `-D warnings`; zero failures.
- `agenda_effects` was the **sixth** module here to arrive correct, tested and uncalled. It is
  now wired into `close_vote` and added to the `wiring.rs` guard list.
- Order matters and is now right: 8.20 enacts a passing law *before* the effect runs, so an
  effect that reads the laws in play sees the one just passed.
- Seed of an Empire's tie goes through the `Table` as a generated decision, like every other
  choice, rather than being decided inside the effect.
- Incentive Program now reveals by **stage**, not off the top. The deck is stage I then stage II
  in order, so the first version would have revealed the wrong stage for most of a game.

## Secrets wired into scoring (authoritative)

- **631 passing tests**; workspace clippy-clean under `-D warnings`; zero failures.
- The 81.1 window now offers **secrets alongside public objectives** (61.6). Closes the gap
  M04-017's evidence recorded as "no secret-objective window".
- A player with no public objective in reach may still have a secret in reach, so the window no
  longer stops at the public list — which is exactly what left satisfied secrets unscoreable.
- A scored secret leaves its owner's hand (61.18); a public objective does not. Which module
  owns the card decides which path the award takes.
- Guarded in `wiring.rs`, since this is precisely the kind of call that falls out silently.
- **Still unwired:** `technology` and `transactions`, each waiting on an action that does not
  exist yet (research, and a transaction window). `exploration` is wired: 35.1 fires on capture.

## Exploration on capture (authoritative)

- **636 passing tests**; workspace clippy-clean under `-D warnings`; zero failures.
- 35.1 now fires: taking a planet **nobody held** explores it; taking one off a rival does not.
  `establish_control` already carried the previous holder for exactly this, and nothing used it
  — a caller told only that control changed would explore every conquest and draw cards the
  rules do not give.
- Guarded in `wiring.rs`. Dropping that call would silently stop every exploration in the game
  while the invasion still looked correct.

## Strategy card abilities (authoritative)

- **641 passing tests**; workspace clippy-clean under `-D warnings`; zero failures.
- First tranche of strategy-card abilities: **Leadership** (52.2/52.3) and **Technology**
  (91.2/91.3). Both use machinery already here — token gain, the payment planner, and research
  — which is why they were the two to start with.
- This is the first caller of `technology::research` and the second of `payment::plans`, so two
  more previously-unwired modules now have a real path into play.
- Not implemented and recorded as such: Leadership's per-token pool choice (the gain goes to
  the strategy pool), and Technology's second research for six resources.
- **Still unwired:** `transactions`, which needs a transaction action that does not exist.

## Implementation status

Measured, not claimed. "Scaffold" means the file compiles and has a plausible shape but its
behaviour is a placeholder.

| Crate | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `ti4-content` | **Implemented** | 28-category corpus loader, source scoping, TE id fallback, manifest cross-check, canonical digests, referential validation, unit catalogue, galaxy and adjacency, faction records and starting-fleet parsing. 121 tests. |
| `ti4-model` | **Implemented** | `id.rs`, `content_types.rs`, `hex.rs`, `state.rs` (45-field `Player`, 52-field `GameState`), `units.rs`, `view.rs` (redaction + leak check). 68 tests. |
| `ti4-engine` | **Partial** | Setup (all decks, two revealed public objectives, one secret per player), the four-phase state machine, the strategy draft (snake order), turn order by initiative, faction seating onto a board, the choice model (options, deciders, validation, decision log, replay), and the seeded RNG with dice. 101 tests. Nothing *generates* options yet, so no turn can be taken. Movement, combat, production, legality, the status phase and the agenda phase are absent — not stubbed. |
| `ti4-policy` | **Stub** | 5 × `todo!()` |
| `ti4-sim` | **Stub** | 6 × `todo!()` |
| `ti4-training` | **Stub** | 6 × `todo!()` |
| `ti4-bridge` | **Stub** | 5 × `todo!()` |
| `ti4-legacy` | **Stub** | 4 × `todo!()` |
| `ti4-cli` | **Stub** | Prints hardcoded version strings |
| `xtask` | **Stub** | Prints a version string |

### Milestone implementation

| Milestone | Planning | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| M00 Oracle and baseline | Written | **Partial** — corpus imported and checksummed; deterministic public-state, redacted-view, choice, resolved-event, finished-outcome, and error projections are executable. No complete oracle exporter, generated fixtures, or differential corpus. Correctness baseline was only collected, never run. Performance baseline disputed (see audit). |
| M01 Repository bootstrap | Written | **Partial** — workspace, toolchain, lints, profiles exist. No CI, no coverage or mutation harness, no benchmark harness, no `benches/`. |
| M02 Content and model | Written | **In progress** — 001–003, 005, 007, 008, 009–012 done. 004, 006, 013–016 outstanding. |
| M03 Choice, timing, replay | Written | **Partial** — 001–006 and 008–015 done (choice, validation, deciders, decision log, pinned RNG with domain separation, dice, event/timing resolver, frequency scopes, canonical hashes, direct timing differential, and generated timing properties). 007 remains blocked; 016 outstanding. |
| M04 Game skeleton | Written | **Partial** — 001, 002, 003, 004, 006, 007 done. 005 (draft resolution), 008–016 outstanding. Setup now builds deterministic decks and deals setup cards. |
| M05 … M13 | Written | **Not started** |

## Repository state

- Working tree: clean after the M04-003 package commit on `wp/m04-003-deck-construction`
- Python oracle tree: clean, unmodified ✅
- Tests: **291 passing** (`cargo test --workspace`) — 121 `ti4-content`, 101 `ti4-engine`,
  68 `ti4-model`, 1 doc-test
- Integration tests: none. All tests are inline `#[cfg(test)]` modules.
- Content corpus: `crates/ti4-content/content/`, 29 files, 1,800 records, byte-identical to
  the oracle and checksummed in `CHECKSUMS.sha256`

## Open blockers and findings

1. **The oracle exporter is incomplete.** M00-009b/c/d/e/f/g provide tested state, redacted-view,
   choice, resolved-event, finished-outcome, and structured-error projections, but no CLI/NDJSON
   stream, fixture manifest, or complete reproducibility campaign exists. Until those are complete, no
   differential parity claim can be made, and M03-014, M04-015, M05-021, M06-018 and all of M12
   remain unimplementable. This is the single largest gap.
2. ~~No independent review of any code package.~~ Waived by the project owner
   (2026-08-11). Recorded here so the standard and the practice do not silently disagree.
3. **No CI.** M01-006/007/008/009 are marked complete but nothing runs on a push.
4. **Throughput gate is ~8× weaker than the master plan intends** — `M00-013a.md` labels a
   sequential measurement as 12-worker throughput. Changing a contractual gate needs
   authority; flagged, not corrected.
5. **`ti4-engine` behaviour is not oracle-derived.** Legality, movement, combat, and
   scoring are placeholders. They must be replaced against named oracle sources rather than
   extended.
6. ~~**`Galaxy` is not wired into the engine.**~~ Closed by M05-003: adjacency is now the basis
   of movement legality.
7. **The status phase is implemented except for scoring; the agenda phase except for voting.**
   A driven round now performs status steps 81.2–81.8 including the real 81.5 token choice, and
   stops at `StatusScoringUnimplemented` (81.1). The agenda phase reveals and orders, then stops
   at `AgendaChoicesUnimplemented`. Neither invents a default.

## Next actions

Rewritten against the tree as measured on 2026-08-12. The previous list named packages that
had already shipped — it is worth re-deriving this rather than trusting it.

1. ~~The `Window` trait.~~ **Done.** Production, invasion and combat are resumable, and
   `AftermathWindow` composes them so the driver steps the whole post-movement sequence one
   decision at a time. The contract divergence introduced in `310d7f5` is closed.
2. ~~M01-006 — CI.~~ Done: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs fmt, clippy (deny), tests, docs and
   the corpus checksums on Windows.
3. **M05-010 — combat modifiers and rerolls**, the last tactical rule. (M05-011 retreat is
   done: announce before dice, defender first, the announcement silences the attacker, and
   what a retreating fleet cannot carry is stranded.)
4. **M00-013 — the performance baseline**, unblocked since the oracle was cleaned and the thing
   that validates the premise of the rewrite.
5. **M06 — general rules**: reactions (016), agenda effects/laws (014), relic effects, and the
   per-card handlers behind exploration and action cards. Done: payment planner (001),
   transactions (002/003), technology (004/005), exploration and fragments (006, part of 007),
   action cards (008), secrets (010) and leaders (015).

## Decisions in force

- Windows-first isolated Rust rewrite.
- The Python repository at `37061c5` is a read-only historical scope/artifact/performance reference;
  official rules and accepted Rust specifications govern behavior.
- Public/semantic compatibility with translation layers where documented.
- Content is compiled into the binary; `ContentStore::from_dir` remains for regenerated or
  reduced corpora, and a test proves the two agree.
- Corpus files are committed byte-identical with SHA-256 checksums and `.gitattributes`
  pinning them against end-of-line translation.
- Independent review is waived for implementation packages by the project owner
  (2026-08-11). Evidence files record what was verified and by what test, not a reviewer.
- Scoped permissions per `SCOPED_PERMISSIONS.md`: packages default to P0/P1.




## Handover (P1-c complete)

- **Objective:** Phase 1 decision-surface alignment, sub-package P1-c — ground-commit, ready-planet
  and free-trade-replenishment surfaces aligned to oracle identity per `engine/invasion.py:253–324`,
  `engine/strategy.py:633–654`, `engine/strategy.py:206–246` (spec `out/p1c_spec.md`).
- **Active milestone/package:** Phase 1 / P1-c — COMPLETE. Next ready package: **P1-f** (misc wording +
  blind-secondary window shape, largest remaining Phase-1 item), then P1-g (behavioral payment/jamming),
  conditional P1-h gated on T6 tie-break hits post-P1-g.
- **Status:** D1 commit surface at both sites: prompt `"commit ground forces in {sys}"`, ids
  `commit|{n}|{planet}`, kind `commit` (`COMMIT_KIND`), label `land {type}[ (damaged)] on {planet}`,
  dedup key `(type, sustained_damage, planet)`, terminator `("done_committing","decline",...)`, plus the
  27.1 Mecatol Rex filter re-read each commit iteration (`mr` in system `"18"`). D2 ready: prompt
  `"ready which planet"`, labels `ready {planet}`, decline removed (forced choice per iteration).
  D3 replenishment: prompt `"let another player replenish commodities"`, faction-name options kind
  `replenish` label `{name} replenishes commodities`, terminator `("done","decline","nobody else
  replenishes")`, explicit generic exclusion, candidate-scoped first-match name→seat. D4 mechanical
  policy rename: bot.rs dispatch/parser/helpers land→commit (identical scores), learned.rs dead local
  arm + LOCAL_DIVERGENCES 13→12, two test fixtures. Six red-first tests (confirmed RED pre-implementation)
  all green; no other test changed.
- **Branch/HEAD:** `codex/stage1-parity-fixes` at P1-e commit `00d7415`; this package's changes
  staged for the focused commit: invasion.rs, strategy_cards.rs, bot.rs, learned.rs + plans updates.
- **Working-tree state:** modified (staged-for-commit): `crates/ti4-engine/src/invasion.rs`,
  `crates/ti4-engine/src/strategy_cards.rs`, `crates/ti4-policy/src/bot.rs`,
  `crates/ti4-policy/src/learned.rs`, `plans/evidence/STAGE2-STALL-INVESTIGATION.md` (§P1-c spec→complete),
  `plans/CONTINUATION_PLAN.md` (P1-c row done). Untracked out/: p1c trace artifacts. Oracle repo untouched.
- **Tests last run and exact results:** fmt clean; ti4-engine **782** lib + 5 doctests (+6 new);
  ti4-policy 102/102 (golden-heads routing with shrunk local-divergence ledger green); ti4-content
  126+1; ti4-training 98/98 release; clippy zero warnings both crates all targets; workspace check clean.
- **Compatibility evidence (T6 vs `out/py_ff_learn_83000001_p1a2.json`, 1868 py / 1147 rust):**
  all six factions max_score_gap=0.000000, choice_mismatches_within_common=0; first structural mismatch
  per faction = recorded classes only (hacan idx1 F1 leader component; other five idx1 blind secondary
  no/yes vocabulary + window shape). Surface-level diff beyond idx alignment: every same-event commit
  pair matches option sets AND labels (hacan 18/18, jolnar 2/2, l1z1x 5/5, letnev 3/3, xxcha 4/4); ready
  and replenish rows oracle-shaped on both sides with differences only from post-break game-state cascade.
  Legacy-form scan of the whole Rust trace: zero old prompts, zero kind-`land`; new surfaces 125 commit +
  10 ready + 33 replenish rows. Rust-vs-rust p1e→p1c: per-faction decision totals identical (no window-shape
  change); first fork in every faction is the rename itself (`land|…`→`commit|…`, or `decline`→`done` for
  jolnar's replenishment), downstream forks 3–27 all cascades — intended feature-space movement, zero forks
  before any renamed-surface decision.
- **Decisions made:** (1) shared helpers `landable_planets`/`commit_options` de-duplicate the two commit
  sites instead of copying oracle text twice. (2) 27.1 Mecatol exclusion treated as option-set identity
  (P1-c scope), re-read per iteration to match the oracle's mid-sequence token removal. (3) explicit
  `faction != "generic"` retain clause kept despite natural equivalence with commodity_limit=0 — spec parity
  + guard against future content. (4) no emissions implemented (verified inert or Phase-2-owned).
- **Open review findings or blockers:** none. No frontier review required: identity/option-set text only,
  no legality/timing/window-shape change; red-first tests + T6 + surface diff + rust-vs-rust fork analysis
  in evidence §P1-c.
- **Next exact action/command:** P1-f spec from the recorded class row (em-dash → `--` prompt normalization
  across prompts; leadership purchase loop vs Rust blind `decline/follow` secondaries incl. no/yes
  vocabulary) — investigate oracle + Rust sites read-only, write `out/p1f_spec.md`, red-first tests,
  implement, gates, T6 re-run vs the same Python artifact.
- **Files to read first after compaction:** this file (handover section); `plans/CONTINUATION_PLAN.md`
  Phase 1 table; evidence §P1-c (`plans/evidence/STAGE2-STALL-INVESTIGATION.md`, from line ~1244).


## Handover (P1-g complete)

- **Objective:** Phase 1 decision-surface alignment, sub-package P1-g — payment-loop mechanics
  (F5 lone-option auto-pick, F6 oracle payload identity, F7 zero-worth face filtering + the
  affordability guard), Xxcha *Archon's Gift* alternate payment faces (F2), Signal Jamming option-set
  parity (F12) per `engine/production.py` and `_jamming_systems`. Spec `out/p1g_spec.md`, split
  f5/f6/f7/f12/f-payload recorded pre-implementation.
- **Active milestone/package:** Phase 1 / P1-g — COMPLETE. Conditional P1-h: CHECKED AND SKIPPED per
  its own gate (post-P1-g T6 shows zero tie-break hits; F11 stays a documented known difference in the
  Phase-2 backlog). Next ready actions: item 2 of `plans/CONTINUATION_PLAN.md` "Path to a startable
  training run" — Phase-1 exit checkpoint (consolidated evidence + handover + compaction), then item 3,
  the C1 dry pilot.
- **Status:** lone payment options are consumed silently at settle (oracle `pay()` auto-pick) so Rust
  traces contain zero degenerate payment questions; payment option identity matches oracle
  (`kind`/`owed`/`source`/`worth`, cross-source `|{source}` id suffix only when the face is genuinely
  cross-source — planet ids containing '|' or single-segment decode safely); zero-worth faces are never
  offered and the affordability guard filters any face whose use would strand the bill; Archon's Gift
  offers its alternate faces with per-face values; `available()` sums max-face per planet. Jamming: pub
  `jamming_systems` (effective galaxy from the driver, ships-only reach, home exclusion via
  `is_home_system`, BTreeSet-sorted), eligibility in `is_playable`/`available_actions`, perform gate
  fizzles on the empty set. PLANET_EXHAUSTED/BREAKTHROUGH_TRIGGERED emissions remain deferred as a
  documented known difference (T6b-verified no bound window).
- **F14 (in-package regression found and fixed):** an early version of P1-g's settle loop had an empty
  `Stage::Done => {}` arm → infinite loop: any game with one production decline could never finish,
  so the multi-hour suite runs genuinely did not terminate (one process accumulated ~65 CPU-hours
  spinning a single instruction) — pathological by construction, not slow. Found by
  A/B-bisecting the P1-f worktree plus temporary instrumentation, fixed with `Stage::Done => break`,
  guarded by regression test `a_declined_production_window_settles_without_spinning`. Post-fix T6 trace
  regenerates **byte-identical** to `out/rust_ff_83000001_p1g.json` (zero behavioral effect on recorded
  evidence). No pre-existing test drove the decline→settle path, which is why all unit tests were green
  on the spinning code.
- **Branch/HEAD:** `codex/stage1-parity-fixes` at P1-f commit `6958935`; this package's changes are
  committed as the focused P1-g commit (this handover included).
- **Working-tree state (at commit):** modified: `crates/ti4-engine/src/{production,action_cards,
  strategy_cards,game}.rs`, `crates/ti4-policy/src/bot.rs` (payload key rename + fixtures),
  `crates/ti4-sim/src/run.rs` (fmt-only re-wrap carried over from P1-f's committed test),
  `plans/evidence/STAGE2-STALL-INVESTIGATION.md` (§P1-g: gates final, F14), `plans/CONTINUATION_PLAN.md`
  (path items 0–1 closed). Untracked out/: p1g spec/handover artifacts. Oracle repo untouched.
- **Tests last run and exact results:** fmt clean workspace-wide; clippy --all-targets zero warnings on
  ti4-engine/ti4-sim/ti4-policy; ti4-content 126, ti4-engine **793 lib + 5 doctests** (net +11 over P1-f:
  T-A lone-option auto-pick, T-B Archon's Gift faces/guard/payloads, T-C zero-worth never offered,
  T-D window settling a lone option in `Stage::Paying`, jamming set/eligibility/no-galaxy rewrites, F14
  regression test; two P1-b prompt tests flipped to assert auto-pick per f5), ti4-legacy 25, ti4-model
  72, ti4-policy 102, **ti4-sim 27/27 (release, wall 0.34 s)**, **ti4-training lib 98/98 (release, wall
  1.16 s)**.
- **Compatibility evidence:** T6 seed 83000001 rot 0 (rounds 4, greedy temp 0.0001, `--full-features`,
  pool save52_e400_n8192) vs unchanged Python artifact `out/py_ff_learn_83000001_p1a2.json` (1868):
  rust p1g = **1106 decisions**; all six factions **max_score_gap=0.000000, zero choice mismatches** on
  common prefixes; first structural mismatch per faction only the recorded F1 class at idx 1/2 (hacan
  leader component absent; sol `faction|orbital_drop` id). Payment questions: Rust p1g **91 with zero
  degenerate (<2 options)** vs P1-f's 106 with 15 and Python's 111 with 0. rust-vs-rust p1f→p1g: every
  first break is an intended delta; pre-fork score movement exactly the f-payload token rename
  (bucket-verified). Trace regenerated post-F14-fix: byte-identical to the recorded artifact.
- **Decisions made:** (1) lone-option auto-pick happens in settle rather than by filtering the option
  list — mirrors oracle `pay()` and keeps degenerate questions out of traces entirely. (2) payment id
  decode keys off the payload's `source` instead of re-splitting the id string, because planet ids may
  contain '|' or be single-segment. (3) zero-worth faces excluded at offer time AND re-checked by the
  affordability guard on every face (both match Python). (4) jamming scope limited to the system set +
  eligibility; the other ~17 per-card eligibility lambdas stay in the F13 backlog. (5) P1-h skipped per
  its recorded gate condition (zero tie-break hits post-P1-g).
- **Open review findings or blockers:** none for P1-g proper; F14 was self-discovered, fixed, and
  regression-tested inside this package. No frontier review required: payment/jamming surface identity
  only — no legality/timing/hidden-information change. Carried unchanged: F1 (leader-component gap)
  gates full-game alignment → Phase 2; F11 tie-break stays Phase-2 backlog; F13 card lambdas stay in the
  Phase-2/Phase-3 backlog with the `is_playable` comment as anchor.
- **Next exact action/command:** C1 dry pilot COMPLETED AND PASSED (2026-08-16; log
  `out/c1_dry_pilot.log`, wall 241 s): champion loaded at internal update u3050, +50 updates to u3100
  with **6,358,098 decisions, 0 errors, 0 zero-movement updates**; boundary panel (192 games/faction)
  clean, aggregate gain +2.229 (se 0.175; `--accept-sigmas 0` per C1 design — sanity signal only);
  checkpoint `out/stage2_p1g_dry_u50.json` structurally valid (`resumed_from` carries the champion
  sha256). Path items 0–3 of `plans/CONTINUATION_PLAN.md` all hold → **Rust is verified startable**.
  STOP POINT (plan decision point #3): a full T4-equivalent run (C2/C3: same seed stream, `--every 50
  --accept-sigmas 0`, n=32, `--panel-step 32`) now **requires operator approval of pre-registered
  thresholds before launch**; Phase 2 legality/timing work additionally requires a frontier review per
  AGENTS.md. Either way the next session resumes from this handover + the continuation plan.
- **Files to read first after compaction:** this file (handover section); `plans/CONTINUATION_PLAN.md`
  "Path to a startable training run" + Phase 1 table; evidence §P1-g (`plans/evidence/
  STAGE2-STALL-INVESTIGATION.md`, last sections, incl. F14).

## Status update: C2 real-gate run stopped; performance reviewed (2026-08-16)

- **C2** (operator-approved, real 2.0σ gate, `--panel-step 32`, +500 updates from u3050): 4
  boundaries before stop — u3100 **+PROMOTED all six factions** (val +2.349 / conf +1.990); u3150,
  u3200, u3250 rejected by per-faction clearance vetoes with no isolated fallback survivor. Every
  boundary showed a real paired gain (+0.98 to +2.35) — the zero-signal stall is gone; rejections are
  principled guardrails. Run ended after the u3250 checkpoint, exit code 1 with **no panic/error
  text** → consistent with external kill (operator "stop run"), no evidence of internal crash.
- **Performance review (spotty CPU — confirmed and quantified):** probe + 3-s sampler over a
  25-update run: utilization % of 32 cores min 3.1 / median 43.1 / mean 34.8 / max 89.8; learning
  phase ~60% (serial `apply()` gradient step between parallel rollout waves, stage1.rs:287); deep
  valleys at phase transitions; **rejected boundaries cost ~3× promoted ones** (~153–182 s each)
  because the isolated fallback runs up to six full validation panels — in C2 that was ~45% of wall
  time producing no promotion. Learning cost drifts +47% per chunk over 200 updates (+9.5% decisions
  → +33% per-decision) — cause not yet isolated. Full numbers: evidence §"C2 real-gate run +
  performance review". Recommendations R1–R4 (pipeline the loop, cheaper fallback, per-eval timing
  logs, drift probe) recorded there; none implemented pending operator decision.
- **New standing rule (operator):** every test/verification run must finish within a **10-minute
  timeout or it is considered failed/broken**; long training runs need explicit approval + monitored
  checkpoints. All subsequent verification work is designed to fit the budget (e.g., 25-update probe
  ≈ 4 min).
- **Next exact action:** operator decision on R1–R4 (which, if any, to implement) and whether to
  relaunch a full run after fixes; otherwise resume from this handover. No uncommitted changes.

## Status update: sustained-learning test launched (2026-08-16)

- **Operator task:** determine whether Stage-2 can *sustainably* get at least one faction to a
  3.0 average VP; fix what blocks it if not. Wall-time improvements approved as prerequisite.
- **VP ceiling probe** (new example `crates/ti4-training/examples/vp_ceiling_probe.rs`; u3100
  accepted champion, 192 games/faction): max game VP is only **4–5**; current means 1.35–1.73 with
  p50 of 1–2 and only ~8–20% of games reaching ≥3 (letnev/jolnar best at ~20%). A *mean* of 3.0
  therefore requires the median game to be a ≥3-VP game — reachable in principle, but a step change
  from current play, not an extrapolation. C2 candidates already hit 1.96 (jolnar) after just 50
  updates, so the early trend is steep; whether it continues toward 3.0 is exactly what this run
  tests.
- **Wall-time attempt reverted:** a `rayon::join` parallelization of the three boundary evaluations
  was implemented and determinism-verified (identical decisions/gains/promotion to C2) but measured
  **3× slower** on the boundary (174 s vs 55 s): concurrent CPU-bound tasks on a fixed pool only
  split threads, plus ~576 live game states thrash memory. Reverted; sequential evaluations are
  back. Real levers remain: fewer evaluations per rejected boundary (isolated-fallback pre-filter —
  semantic change, needs approval) or faster games (engine-level).
- **Sustained run launched:** `stage2_training` resuming from C2's checkpoint (learner u3250,
  accepted = u3100 champion), **+1000 updates → u4250**, `--every 50 --panel-step 32`, real 2.0σ
  gate, seed stream continues at base 74_000_000 stride 10_000 (next chunk u3250..u3300). Log
  `out/sustained_u1000.log`, checkpoint written every boundary. Success = some faction's accepted
  panel mean VP reaches ≥3.0 and holds; plateau well below after ~1000 updates = the finding, then
  diagnose (ceiling vs gate vs reward). ETA ~1.5–2 h; compact reports at boundaries.
- **Standing rule (operator, 2026-08-16):** never train or evaluate with an 8-round horizon unless
  specifically instructed — it wastes compute. All runs stay on the 4-round horizon.
- **Operator claim under investigation:** "the python version used to crack 5 vp at the last run
  before port to rust started." Exhaustive search of `D:/Projects/ti4-engine` (all .log files, all
  JSON checkpoints incl. subdirectories and audit/learner metrics, telemetry arrays, git history for
  deleted logs) found **no record of any faction averaging ≥2.5 VP**; the maximum anywhere is
  jolnar 2.34 at u3350 in `out/stage2_pg_six_c_20260810.log`. Single-game maxima of 5 VP do exist
  (Rust ceiling probe: jolnar/l1z1x max=5 on current profiles), so the memory may be a single-game
  result. Awaiting operator pointer to the specific full log if one exists elsewhere.
- **RESOLVED: the "python cracked 5 vp" claim (operator pointer: python branch / stats folder / HDD
  backup).** Found in `E:\ti4-engine\archive` (HDD backup of evolution-trainer runs, all with
  `horizon_round: 4`, i.e. directly comparable):
  - `stage2_blank_002`: **xxcha sustained ~4.5–4.6 avg VP** (4.57@g122, 4.54@g41, 4.53@g43,
    4.49@g124, 4.43@g130) — this is the "cracked 5 vp" memory; no run ever recorded ≥5.0 exactly.
  - `stage2_rich_001`: sol 4.25@g414, hacan 4.25@g363 — its manifest shows **`--vp-gate 5.0`**
    (the target the operator remembers).
  - `stage2_from_s1gen222_001`: letnev ~4.0–4.1 sustained g238–g258.
  - `stage2_blank_001`: letnev 2.71 (early, short run).
  **Critical distinction:** these are the *evolution* trainer (`tools/evolve_save54_three_player.py`,
  mutation + per-faction champion selection, seeds=12/gen), NOT the policy-gradient trainer that was
  ported to Rust. The pg trainer plateaus at ~2.0–2.3 avg VP in both Python and Rust on the same
  horizon. So: sustained ≥3 avg VP is *demonstrated achievable* on this horizon — by a different
  algorithm than the one currently implemented in Rust. Decision needed: keep pushing pg, port the
  evolution approach, or hybrid.

## Pivot: fixing the pg plateau (2026-08-16)

- **Operator direction:** the target stays a *fully learned, gradient-search* policy (the evolution
  archive results are only proof that ≥3 avg VP is reachable on this horizon by some policy class;
  they evolved hand-crafted heuristic weights, not learned heads). So: find and fix what caps the
  pg trainer at ~2.0–2.3.
- **Diagnosis from sustained-run telemetry (u3050..u3900):** `mean_return_std` stays healthy and
  slowly rises (~1.8→2.0) while per-head weight `movement` decays (~1.6→1.3). Return variance is not
  dying; the optimizer is taking smaller steps in a region where games still differ but VP does not
  improve — the signature of a **local optimum / flat basin**, not entropy collapse or reward death.
  The current policy already plays ≥3-VP games in ~8–20% of games (ceiling probe), so the feature
  space can express good play; it must be made consistent.
- **Sustained run stopped at u3900** (checkpointed cleanly; operator redirected priorities). Final
  state: jolnar accepted @u3550 (~2.1 VP), other five factions at u3100 heads; Rust pg dynamics
  matched Python's boundary-for-boundary through this point.
- **Experiment A launched:** `--entropy 0.05` (5× the reference 0.01, new CLI flag added to
  stage2_training.rs and recorded in checkpoint arguments), from u3900, +400 updates → u4300,
  `--every 100 --panel-step 32`, real gate. Log `out/exp_entropy05.log`. Success = candidate avg VP
  clearly exceeds the ~2.1–2.3 plateau (ideally a promotion ≥3). If it fails: next experiments are
  blank-start stage-2 (tests whether the Stage-1 prior is the blocker) and reward shaping toward
  high-VP games.
- **Experiment A (entropy 0.05 only) — VERDICT: no sustained break.** u3900→u4300, four boundaries,
  all rejected; candidate VP per boundary (sol/letnev/xxcha/hacan/jolnar/l1z1x):
  - u4000: 2.17 / 2.20 / 2.15 / 2.02 / **2.38** / 2.23
  - u4100: 1.92 / 2.15 / 2.14 / 2.04 / 2.27 / 2.03
  - u4200: 1.99 / 2.12 / 2.08 / 1.91 / 2.05 / 1.93
  - u4300: 1.92 / 2.08 / 2.00 / 1.85 / 2.10 / 1.81
  The u4000 spike regressed; no upward trend (slight downward drift). Exploration without
  directional pressure does not escape the basin — it wanders in it. Rejections were clearance
  vetoes (jolnar/sol), consistent with VP-for-clearance trades under flatter policies.
- **Implemented `--high-vp-bonus`** (default 0 = reference behavior preserved): terminal reward
  bonus paid when a seat finishes with ≥3 VP, credited at the final slot so every decision's return
  carries it exactly; field on `Reward` + `FactionPlan`, CLI flag recorded in checkpoint arguments,
  focused unit test (`the_high_vp_bonus_pays_only_when_the_seat_finishes_at_or_above_three`).
  Rationale: the reference reward pays per-VP via potential differences, so crossing 2→3 is one
  more unit of weight spread over ~7M decisions — weak credit for exactly the threshold that
  matters. Full `ti4-training --lib` release suite running before commit.
- **Experiment B (queued):** entropy 0.05 + high-vp-bonus 0.5, same u3900 start, +400 updates →
  u4300, `--every 100 --panel-step 32`, real gate — directly comparable to A. Success = sustained
  candidate VP above ~2.3 with an upward trend (ideally a promotion ≥3). If B also fails: next is
  blank-start stage-2 (tests whether the Stage-1 prior itself is the blocker) and/or bonus 1.0.
- **Operator mission (2026-08-16):** clear Stage 2 with learned heads; Rust must be ≥5× faster than a
  comparable Python process on the same workload; no prolonged CPU idle during runs; learning-algorithm
  experiments explicitly permitted. Standing rules unchanged (4-round horizon, 10-minute test budget for
  verification runs — long training runs are operator-approved monitored work).
- **Experiment B (entropy 0.05 + high-vp-bonus 0.5) — VERDICT: no break.** u3900→u4300, four boundaries,
  all rejected; candidate VP per boundary (sol/letnev/xxcha/hacan/jolnar/l1z1x):
  - u4000: 2.05 / **2.28** / 2.16 / 2.16 / 2.22 / 2.23
  - u4100: 1.88 / 2.10 / — / — / — / — (rejected)
  - u4200: 1.95 / 2.12 / — / — / — / — (rejected; jolnar clearance −0.036 veto)
  - u4300: 2.02 / 2.09 / — / — / — / — (rejected; xxcha clearance −0.073 veto)
- **Revised diagnosis (supersedes "plateau/basin"):** the learner is NOT stuck. Checkpoint audit history
  shows candidates beat the frozen champion by **+1.9 to +2.1 aggregate VP per boundary (~6–7σ paired)**;
  every rejection is a **per-faction clearance veto (0.03, raw panel means)**: the ≥3-VP bonus pressure makes
  the learner trade opening safety for mid-game VP (xxcha −0.073 clr for +0.51 VP at u4300). The gate blocks
  real Pareto moves; isolated fallback cannot save them because gains are interdependent across the table.
  Champion frozen at u3100/u3550 values while learner oscillates ~2.0–2.3 = equilibrium, not a basin.
- **Plan (out/stage2_clearance_plan.md):** P-A `--pipeline` staleness=1 training loop (fixes tail-idle,
  target ≥90% duty); P-B clearance-aware reward (`--clearance-floor/--clearance-weight`, default off) so the
  learner finds high-VP play inside the gate's 0.03 clearance band; P-C long clearing run with real gate.
  Gate semantics stay oracle-compatible (no veto changes).
- **Python comparable baseline RUNNING:** `out/py_baseline_launch.sh` — same champion u3050, seed base 74M
  stride 10k, 16 seeds × 6 rotations, horizon 4, save52 pool, workers=32, eval-every 50, 100 updates.
  First boundary u3100: **all six factions promoted** — matches Rust C2's first-boundary decision exactly
  (parity signal). CPU sampler logging to out/pybase_cpu_samples.txt for duty-cycle measurement.
- **Reachability proof in-protocol:** six-faction evolution run `save52_six_stage2_FINAL.json` reached
  hacan best_vp=4.83@g55, jolnar 3.96, letnev 3.71 (panel means, horizon 4) — ≥3 VP is reachable in the
  six-faction protocol by some policy class; pg must be steered there.

## Scheduling package + speed measurement (2026-08-16)

- **P-A/P-C scheduling implemented and measured** (evidence: `plans/evidence/STAGE2-SCHEDULING-WAVES.md`):
  - Root cause of spotty CPU: game-length variance leaves each update's fixed 96-game batch with
    stragglers; learning phase ran at **52% utilization** (16.7/32 cores) in the pure-learning probe.
  - `--rollout-depth D` (default 1 = reference): D consecutive updates' games roll out in one shared
    parallel wave before applying gradients (bounded staleness D-1; per-game results and apply order
    unchanged). **Depth=4: learning 357.3s → 293.0s (+18%), utilization 52% → 63%.** Depth=8 regresses
    (305.5s) — depth 4 is the recommended speed setting.
  - `--pipeline` (background-thread overlap, staleness 1): implemented but **measured worse on this
    machine** (652s vs 503s per 100 updates; memory pressure from ~192 live games). Kept behind its
    flag for other machines. Mutually exclusive with `--rollout-depth > 1` at the CLI.
  - New unit tests: wave == sequential per-group play (frozen profiles); empty-group handling.
    `ti4-training --lib` release **102/102**; clippy/fmt clean.
- **Hot-path attribution** (temporary instrumentation, removed): feature construction ≈ 5.5× scoring;
  policy side is ~32% of game time, engine ~68%. Policy micro-opts alone cannot reach 5x wall-time.
- **Python comparables measured** (same champion u3050, seed base 74M/stride 10k, save52 pool):
  - Python `workers=32`, train-seeds=16: **1034 s / 100 updates** (`out/py_baseline_u100.*`); u3100 all
    six promoted (matches Rust C2). Per-game ~1.73 core-s; avg 19/32 cores.
  - Python natural defaults `workers=1`, train-seeds=8: **2977 s / 25 updates** (`out/py_default_u25.*`);
    u3075 all six promoted (consistent dynamics). Per-game ~1.74 core-s single worker.
  - Rust reference depth=1: **503 s / 100 updates**; per-game ~0.62 core-s → **~2.8x per-game engine
    speedup** vs Python; wall-time ratio vs maxed-out Python currently 2.0-2.8x depending on whole-run
    average cores (Python sustains ~19, Rust reference ~14.3).
- **5x arithmetic recorded plainly:** total CPU for the standard workload ≈ 7,000 core-s; on 32 cores
  the wall-time floor is ~219 s = a ceiling of **~4.7x vs Python@w32 even at perfect utilization**.
  Reaching 5x against maxed-out Python also needs ~6-8% less total CPU work (boundary/I/O) or slightly
  faster games. Against Python's shipped default (`workers=1`, train-seeds=8), Rust is **>40x** on
  identical game counts. Which configuration defines "comparable" is an operator call; both numbers are
  in the evidence file.
- **Next:** (1) commit scheduling package; (2) implement P-B clearance-aware reward
  (`--clearance-weight`, default 0, final-slot penalty per uncleared opening — design in
  `out/pb_prep_notes.md`); (3) launch the long clearing run from u4300 with entropy 0.05 +
  high-vp-bonus 0.5 + clearance-weight ~1.0 + `--rollout-depth 4`, real gate, monitored checkpoints.

## Status (2026-08-16, after scheduling commit)

- Scheduling package committed: `0d0c30a` (`--rollout-depth`, `--pipeline`, group-wave rollout API,
  evidence `plans/evidence/STAGE2-SCHEDULING-WAVES.md`).
- P-B clearance-aware reward committed: `f168a26` (`--clearance-weight`, default 0 = reference;
  unit test `the_clearance_penalty_pays_only_when_the_opening_misses_the_bar`; lib suite 103/103).
- **P-C clearing run LAUNCHED** (operator-approved long run, monitored): from u4300 checkpoint
  (`out/exp_bonus05_entropy05_u400.json`), +600 updates → u4900, `--entropy 0.05 --high-vp-bonus 0.5
  --clearance-weight 1.0 --rollout-depth 4`, real gate, `--every 100 --panel-step 32`. Log
  `out/clearing_run.log`, CPU sampler `out/clearing_cpu.txt` (10 s cadence), output checkpoint
  `out/clearing_run_u600.json`. Expected ~50 min. Success signal: clearance vetoes stop firing and
  promotions resume with candidate VP trending up; target remains ≥3.0 mean VP for at least one
  faction on its panel. If flat after u4500: raise clearance-weight to 2.0 or high-vp-bonus to 1.0.
- **F15 (boundary-phase idle gap): diagnosed, fixed, verified.** Operator report: CPU idles ~10 s
  between spikes during runs. Instrumented probes (`out/dbg_boundary*.log`) proved each 192-game
  panel plays in ~3–4 s but a ~10–12 s serial gap followed every panel evaluation (growing to
  ~12.6 s within one boundary). Root cause: the trainer's `evaluate()` consumed full training
  rollouts — every decision's trajectory with all legal options' feature vectors plus per-decision
  progress snapshots — gigabytes per panel that it never reads, freed serially on the main thread
  at each drop. Fix: new evaluation-only rollout API (`play_rotated_batch_evaluation`,
  `play_rotated_save54_pool_batch_evaluation`) with bots built without `.recording()`; all prior
  public APIs unchanged (training still records). Parity unit test pins identical finals + empty
  trajectories. Result on the identical workload: boundary phase **~136 s → ~15 s**, learning
  block unchanged (~228–231 s), gate decisions unchanged (same clearance vetoes). Evidence:
  `plans/evidence/STAGE2-SCHEDULING-WAVES.md` §F15. Checks: ti4-training lib **104/104** release,
  clippy no new warnings vs HEAD, fmt clean.
- **P-C clearing run status:** killed at u4700 (checkpointed cleanly to
  `out/clearing_run_u600.json`) when the F15 idle-gap complaint was filed; boundaries u4400–u4700
  all rejected by clearance vetoes with VP flat ~2.0–2.3 — the reward-shape question (P-B/P-C) is
  still open and independent of F15. Resume from `out/clearing_run_u600.json` (+600 updates →
  u4900, same flags: `--entropy 0.05 --high-vp-bonus 0.5 --clearance-weight 1.0 --rollout-depth 4`,
  real gate, `--every 100 --panel-step 32`) now that the trainer no longer idles between panels.
- **Operator gate-semantics decision (P-E): per-faction vetoes disabled for Stage-2 runs.** Rationale
  (operator, verbatim intent): one candidate regressing must not block every other candidate that
  did not; if a faction's metrics dip because the others improved, that is competition and it will
  catch up. Implementation: no gate code change — existing CLI flags set to unfireable values:
  `--max-faction-clearance-regression 1.0` (clearance ∈ [0,1], so candidate < champion − 1.0 is
  impossible) and `--max-faction-vp-regression 10.0` (VP cannot regress by more than ~5). The
  aggregate margin (0.05/faction) and paired 2σ evidence clauses remain in force, so a promotion
  must still be a real net improvement beyond noise; the isolated fallback's own-VP-improvement
  requirement also remains. This is an explicit project-level deviation from the oracle's default
  gate (Python defaults 0.03/0.15) authorized by the operator; reference runs keep the defaults.
  Motivation data: at u5100 every faction except jolnar beat the frozen champion by +0.2 to +0.5
  VP, yet all boundaries were rejected on sol/jolnar clearance vetoes while hacan/xxcha had already
  recovered inside the band; the uniform clearance penalty was also degrading jolnar (clearance fell
  73% → 68% under it) instead of helping it clear.
- **P-E run LAUNCHED** from u5100 (`out/clearing_run2_u300.json`), +500 updates → u5600, boundaries
  at u5200/5300/5400/5500/5600: `--entropy 0.05 --high-vp-bonus 1.0 --clearance-weight 1.0
  --rollout-depth 4` plus the two veto-disabling flags above; real aggregate/sigma gate otherwise,
  `--every 100`. Bonus escalated 0.5 → 1.0 per the pre-planned rule (mean VP plateaued ~2.0–2.2
  under 0.5 for ~1100 updates); clearance-weight relaxed 2.0 → 1.0 since it no longer gates and was
  distorting jolnar. Log `out/noveto_run.log`, output `out/noveto_run_u500.json`. Success signal:
  promotions resume (isolated or assembled) with candidate mean VP trending toward ≥3.0 for at
  least one faction; the target remains a fully-learned head clearing Stage 2 at ≥3.0 mean VP.
- **P-E results:** u5200 ALL SIX PROMOTED (assembled) — first promotion in the Stage-2 saga; net
  gain +1.79 ≫ 2σ. u5300–u5600 rejected at +0.08/+0.11/+0.16/+0.07, inside the noise band (sigma
  clause correctly held). New champion mean VP ≈ 1.98. Log `out/noveto_run.log`.
- **Per-faction own-merit gate implemented** (operator final decision: no cross-faction conflation;
  clearance counts as own merit): assembled promotion, aggregate margin, table-level sigma, and
  cross-faction vetoes all removed. Each head is judged on its own paired gain (>0.05 and >2σ of
  its own SE) + own clearance (within 0.03 of its own champion), validation AND confirmation
  panels; factions promote independently in a batch per boundary. `PanelEvaluation` now carries
  per-faction VP-by-seed; table-level pairing deleted as dead conflation machinery. Evidence:
  `plans/evidence/STAGE2-STALL-INVESTIGATION.md` §"P-E results + per-faction own-merit gate".
  Checks: example tests **14/14**, ti4-training lib **104/104** release, clippy no new warnings in
  touched files, fmt clean, `--eval-only` smoke on u5600 checkpoint behaves as designed.
- **Overnight run LAUNCHED** from u5600 (`out/noveto_run_u500.json`), +4000 updates → u9600,
  `--every 100 --panel-step 32`: `--entropy 0.05 --high-vp-bonus 1.0 --clearance-weight 1.0
  --rollout-depth 4`, per-faction gate at defaults. Log `out/overnight_u4000.log`, output
  `out/overnight_u4000.json`. Expected wall ≈ 3.5 h; checkpoints every boundary so nothing is lost
  if killed. Next action on resume: read the log's promotion lines, check champion mean VP trend
  toward ≥3.0, and decide bonus escalation (2.0) or per-faction reward targeting if flat again.
- **Overnight run COMPLETE** (u5600 → u9600, +4000 updates, 12973.5 s ≈ 3.6 h, 3.243 s/update,
  zero errors across ~445M decisions). Per-faction gate delivered **6 independent promotions**:
  u6000 xxcha, u6700 hacan, u7100 l1z1x, u9300 xxcha (+0.172 val / +0.188 conf), u9500 hacan
  (+0.151 / +0.182), u9600 jolnar (+0.208 / +0.349). Champion mean VP rose ~1.98 → **2.35**;
  final champion panel (pre-u9600 measurement): hacan 2.49, xxcha 2.48, sol 2.44, l1z1x 2.28,
  letnev 2.23, jolnar 2.17; mean clearance 0.85 (jolnar 0.73 is the weak spot — its own clearance
  clause will keep gating it). No faction at ≥3.0 yet; best hacan 2.49. Checkpoint
  `out/overnight_u4000.json`. Next decision: continue as-is vs escalate `--high-vp-bonus` 1.0 →
  2.0 for stronger directional pressure toward the ≥3-VP target.
- **Run with --every 500 launched then killed at u11100** (operator parameter change mid-run):
  from u9600 (`out/overnight_u4000.json`), +4000 → u13600 planned, same flags as overnight. First
  three boundaries (u10100/u10600/u11100) all rejected; binding constraint shifted to clearance
  regression — l1z1x at u10600 had +0.203 own gain (>2σ=0.184, genuine improvement) but was held
  by its own clearance clause (0.828 vs 0.859). Candidates systematically trading opening
  reliability for VP under bonus-1.0 pressure. Checkpoint `out/run_e500_u4000.json`.
- **Two-path own-merit gate implemented** (operator clarification: a large enough CLEARANCE gain
  should accept bounded VP regression — clearance is merit, not just a guard). Each faction now has
  two promotion paths, both requiring validation AND confirmation panels to pass: **VP merit** — own
  paired VP gain > `--accept-vp-margin` (0.05) and > `--accept-sigmas` × its own SE, with own
  clearance within `--max-faction-clearance-regression` of its champion's; or **clearance merit** —
  own paired clearance gain ≥ new `--clearance-gain-bar` (default 0.03) and > σ × its own SE, with
  own VP regression bounded by `--max-faction-vp-regression` (0.15). The passing path is recorded per
  faction in history (`promotion_paths`). Per-seed clearance pairing added
  (`PanelEvaluation.faction_clearance_by_seed`, `GainEvidence::paired_faction_clearance`). Tests:
  14/14 example (7 two-path tests incl. "a large clearance gain accepts bounded VP regression"),
  lib 104/104 release, clippy/fmt clean; end-to-end smoke on u11100 shows both paths naming their
  clauses correctly (xxcha's +0.0365 clearance gain would pass at 1σ with its −0.125 VP regression
  inside the bound — exactly the intended behavior).
- **New run LAUNCHED** from u11100 (`out/run_e500_u4000.json`), +4000 updates → u15100, boundaries
  every 500: `--accept-sigmas 1.0 --clearance-weight 5.0 --entropy 0.05 --high-vp-bonus 1.0
  --rollout-depth 4 --panel-step 32 --every 500` (operator directive: "reduce to 1 sigma, clearance
  should be heavily rewarded and weighted for promotion until like 99%"). Output
  `out/run_2path_u4000.json`, log `out/run_2path.log`.
- **Two-path run COMPLETE** (u11100 → u15100, +4000 updates, 12049.0 s ≈ 3.3 h, 3.012 s/update,
  zero errors). Five independent promotions across five factions — only letnev never promoted:
  u12100 jolnar (**clearance merit**: +0.104 clr ≥ bar at 1σ, VP −0.031 in bound) and l1z1x (VP
  merit +0.146, own clearance also up); u12600 xxcha (VP merit +0.083, clearance up 0.839→0.896);
  u13600 sol (**clearance merit**: +0.037 clr at 1σ, VP −0.042 in bound); u14600 hacan (**clearance
  merit**: +0.047 clr at 1σ with VP also +0.042). Three of five promotions used the new clearance-merit
  path — exactly the operator's intended behavior. Rejected boundaries (u11600/u13100/u14100/u15100)
  were inside-noise candidates with named per-clause reasons. Final champion panel (u15100 fresh
  panel, 192 games): hacan 2.56/0.880, jolnar 2.36/0.823, l1z1x 2.33/0.880, letnev 2.19/0.885,
  sol 2.26/0.953, xxcha 2.34/0.901 — mean VP ≈ 2.34 on that panel (panel-to-panel variance ±~0.1;
  the ratchet evidence is the paired per-boundary gains), mean clearance 0.887 (up from 0.85 at
  u9600). Checkpoint `out/run_2path_u4000.json` (run_complete: true). Next decision: continue with
  another +4000 block under the same regime, or adjust parameters (e.g. clearance-gain-bar, bonus)
  per operator direction.
- **`--no-boundaries` pure-learning mode added** (commit d30a20b): no boundary evaluation, no gate,
  no promotion — only training and per-block telemetry; champion frozen for the whole run. Telemetry
  and per-block checkpointing still run every block so `--every N` gives intermediate reports without
  any measurement or banking. Default off; existing runs unchanged. Smoke-verified (20 updates / two
  blocks, zero boundary lines).
- **Pure-learning experiment COMPLETE (killed by operator at u19100 of a planned +5000 from u15100):**
  four full 1000-update blocks ran with zero boundaries/promotions — learning dynamics healthy and
  steady-state throughout (movement ~41–57, mean-return-sd 2.59–3.04, ~106–109M decisions/block,
  zero errors; block times drifting up slowly 43.6→49 min as games deepen). Decisive measurement via
  extended `vp_ceiling_probe` (new: `--table profiles|accepted`, per-game min/max + clearance columns)
  on identical 192 games for both tables at u19100: **the unbanked learner had drifted BELOW its own
  frozen champion on 5 of 6 factions** — sol +0.16 VP (only gainer), letnev −0.09 VP with clearance
  collapsing 0.802→0.615, jolnar −0.19 VP, xxcha/hacan/l1z1x −0.08 to −0.11; all deltas far beyond
  paired SE (~0.06–0.08). Conclusion recorded plainly: unbanked policy gradient wanders off the local
  optimum it already found — the boundary/ratchet is not overhead, it is what converts exploration
  into retained progress. The experiment demonstrated both halves: healthy dynamics AND drift when
  unbanked. Checkpoint `out/run_pure_u5000.json` at u19100 (run_complete false; partial block 5
  discarded by design). Champion state unchanged from u15100 (`out/safepoint_u15100_pre_nobound.json`).

## OBS-008c1 payment decision surface (2026-09-04)

- Active branch: `wp/obs-008c1-payment-decision-surface`, based on `229519b`.
- First bounded `OBS-008c` slice: choices now carry optional typed context, options carry
  non-serialized analytic previews, and decision records retain producer-supplied context.
- Shared resource/influence payment faces expose exact spendable-pool and trade-good aftermath.
  Payment questions expose full bill, transaction-local credit/already-paid amount, remaining debt,
  option-count flexibility, overpay and stable subtype through the existing transferable `pay`
  family; unknown and unavailable previews remain distinct and never become numeric zero.
- No option set, id, label, payload, payment legality or payment application changed. Old choices
  remain serde-compatible and V1 decision hashes strip context as before.
- Counterfactual tests independently vary paid debt, option count and exact consequence, and prove
  the paid-debt fact survives the MLP projection.
- Checks: engine 1,139 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs; policy 196/196 (the 102-game deterministic
  campaign passed separately in 328.81 s); training 133; strict all-target Clippy green for engine
  and policy.
- Independent Tier-C review first found missing paired counterfactual coverage (P2); fixed and
  rechecked **PASS / APPROVED**, with no remaining finding.
- Next: `OBS-008c2`, marginal production choices and post-build production/capacity/fleet
  constraints. Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-008C1.md`.

## OBS-003h slice 1: action-card context producers (2026-09-04)

- All 12 registered action_cards.rs producers (13 Choice sites) attach typed DecisionContext.
  pick and predicted_outcome are genuinely card-agnostic (pick alone has ~25 call sites) and are
  typed generically (pick_{kind}, a shared Rule 8 prediction subtype) rather than attributed to one
  card -- recorded as a residual, not silently claimed complete.
- Split from the rest of OBS-003h per the plan's own allowance: faction_abilities.rs, reactions.rs,
  relics.rs, exploration.rs, thunders_edge.rs, secrets.rs, laws.rs remain for a second slice.
- No legal-set, option-ID, or application change; no features.rs change (OBS-008g reads this into
  features later).
- Checks: engine 1,173 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs; policy 201 + the 102-game deterministic
  campaign in 270.98 s (267.34 s for OBS-003g -- no regression); training 133; strict Clippy and
  `cargo fmt --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-003H1.md`. **Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING**, alongside
  OBS-008c2b, the production-discount bug fix, OBS-008c3, OBS-003d, OBS-003e slices 1-2, OBS-003f,
  and OBS-003g -- nine packages now owed review. The user has started an independent review pass
  (Codex) over this session's outstanding packages, in parallel with continued implementation.
- Next: OBS-003h slice 2 (the remaining seven files), then OBS-003i (prompt-free projection, after
  all typed context exists), then OBS-005/006, OBS-007c, before the OBS-008 decision-option
  packages.

---

## OBS-003g: agenda context producers (2026-09-04)

- agenda_effects.rs's three registered producers attach typed DecisionContext: choose_structure
  (Homeland Defense Act's PDS choice, Content("defense_act")/defense_act_choose_pds),
  ask_the_speaker (8.18's tied-election call, Rule("8.18")/agenda_elect_tiebreak), and
  resolve_with's own direct ask (Colonial Redistribution's settler choice,
  Content("redistribution")/redistribution_choose_settler).
- Kept distinct from vote.rs's own vote_tiebreak (OBS-003e slice 2, 8.19a, speaker breaks a tie
  between outcomes): agenda_elect_tiebreak (8.18) is the speaker naming which tied PLAYER an
  agenda's own election names -- a different rule, recorded so the two are not later conflated.
- No legal-set, option-ID, or application change; no features.rs change (OBS-008f reads this into
  features later).
- Checks: engine 1,172 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs; policy 201 + the 102-game deterministic
  campaign in 267.34 s (266.91 s for OBS-003f -- no regression); training 133; strict Clippy and
  `cargo fmt --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-003G.md`. **Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING**, alongside
  OBS-008c2b, the production-discount bug fix, OBS-008c3, OBS-003d, OBS-003e slices 1-2, and
  OBS-003f -- eight packages now owed review.
- Next, per the plan's own recommended order: OBS-003h (reaction/content, split by crate if >5
  files), OBS-003i (prompt-free projection, after all typed context exists), then OBS-005/006,
  OBS-007c, before the OBS-008 decision-option packages.

## Tier-C remediation: OBS-008c2b and OBS-003e1 (2026-09-04)

- Active branch: `wp/tier-c-review-remediation-obs008c2b-003e1`, based on `6ccdfb0`.
- The c2b placement surface no longer claims `fleet_excess + capacity_excess` is an exact future
  removal count; it exposes the two pre-enforcement violations separately. The shared redistribution
  helper now receives its origin: Warfare stays card-scoped; status uses Rule 81.5.
- Intentional package files: production, strategy_cards, game, policy features, specification,
  evidence, and this execution state. Preserve the unrelated modified `action_cards.rs` and the two
  untracked samples.
- Checks: engine 1,175 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs; policy 202/202 (102-game campaign separately
  passed in 307.26 s from an isolated temporary target); training 133; strict all-target Clippy and
  diff check green. Formatter output is only the concurrently modified, out-of-scope exploration
  file. Independent Tier-C re-review **PASS / APPROVED**: it confirmed truthful pre-enforcement
  excess facts plus the Rule 81.5 source, status subtype, and neutral prompt. Commit only the
  scoped paths afterward.

---

## OBS-003h slice 2: reaction and remaining content context producers (2026-09-04)

- Continuation of `576150a`'s action-card slice: exploration, faction abilities, laws, reactions,
  relics, secret-objective hand-limit enforcement, and Thunder's Edge expedition choices now attach
  their real typed source and stable subtype. The relic technology helper receives the originating
  content alias, so Enigmatic Device exploration and relic versions remain distinguishable.
- No legal set, option ID/label, mechanics, replay behavior, or policy feature changed. A captured
  Ion Storm decision proves a real exploration ask carries `Content("ion_storm")` and
  `ion_storm_choose_reward` instead of relying on its prompt.
- Specification: `plans/OBS-003H2_REACTION_CONTENT_CONTEXT.md`; evidence:
  `plans/evidence/OBS-003H2.md`. Full engine (1,176 + 4 + 5), ordinary policy (201), and training
  (133) suites pass alongside focused coverage and strict engine Clippy. Independent Tier-C review
  is **PASS / APPROVED** after correcting the evidence inventory from 20 to the independently
  verified 17 scoped `Choice::new` sites. Formatter output is confined to an out-of-package
  pre-existing `strategy_cards.rs` hunk from the preceding remediation commit. Only the seven named
  engine files plus this package's plan/evidence/state may be staged.

---

## OBS-003i prompt-free MLP projection (2026-09-04)

- Preserves the schema-4 extractor and proves MLP-vector invariance to prompt and
  option-label rewording while retaining stable option-ID distinction. Focused regressions pass.
- Tier-C review found a P1 compatibility break: schema-6 bundles may have learned nonzero
  `prompt-kind` rows. Suppressing that input without a versioned bundle/projection ABI would let
  old bundles load while silently changing their behavior.
- User selected fail-closed compatibility: schema-7 bundle manifests require `projection_abi: 2`
  before tensors/model construction. Schema-6 prompt-bearing bundles now reject clearly, rather
  than silently ignoring learned prompt-kind weights. Tier-C P1 is resolved and re-reviewed; the
  corrected schema terminology closes its P2 note. Policy 202/202-with-campaign-skipped and MLP
  91/91 pass. Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-003I.md`.

---

## OBS-004 handover checkpoint (2026-09-04)

- OBS-004 is split before implementation. First slice: capability-bound actor-owned play-area and
  private inventory, then bounded policy facts and actor/opponent mutation leak tests. Preserve the
  existing no-player-argument `SeatObservation` access pattern and never expose arbitrary state or
  opponent-private holdings.
- Durable continuation: `plans/HANDOVER_2026-09-04_OBS004.md`.

---

## OBS-003f: trade context producers (2026-09-04)

- transactions::TradeWindow's two stages (Proposing, Answering) attach typed DecisionContext --
  Rule 60, subtypes propose_transaction/answer_transaction, target the counterpart. This is the
  entire producer surface the row names, confirmed against the OBS-002a registry
  (transactions.rs::pending_choice, count 2, is the module's only producer). "Promises" live inside
  Terms as part of the same offer/answer question; "replenishment" is strategy_cards::gain_tokens's
  family, already typed in OBS-003e slice 1.
- No legal-set, option-ID, or application change; no features.rs change (OBS-008e reads this into
  features later).
- Checks: engine 1,171 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs; policy 201 + the 102-game deterministic
  campaign in 266.91 s (265.26 s for OBS-003e slice 2 -- no regression); training 133; strict
  Clippy and `cargo fmt --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-003F.md`. **Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING**, alongside
  OBS-008c2b, the production-discount bug fix, OBS-008c3, OBS-003d, and OBS-003e slices 1-2 --
  seven packages now owed review.
- Next, per the plan's own recommended order: OBS-003g (agenda), OBS-003h (reaction/content, split
  by crate if >5 files), OBS-003i (prompt-free projection, after all typed context exists), then
  OBS-005/006, OBS-007c, before the OBS-008 decision-option packages.

---

## OBS-003e slice 2: turn/token/scoring context producers, row complete (2026-09-04)

- Closes OBS-003e: technology.rs's five remaining reactive asks (Psychoarchaeology, Transit
  Diodes, Chaos Mapping, Predictive Intelligence, Bio-Stims), tokens::TokenGain (context attached
  at game.rs::legal_options's dispatch site, the window's only real caller and the only place with
  a board position to read phase/round from), objectives::ScoringWindow (score_objective for the
  mixed status-phase list, score_secret_objective for the event-scoped secret-only path), draft's
  strategy-card selection, and vote's three branches (cast_vote, vote_exhaust_planet,
  vote_tiebreak).
- Added a shared choice::Capturing decider (records every Choice, context included, delegating the
  answer) rather than a fourth local copy of what invasion.rs and strategy_cards.rs each already
  wrote separately in earlier packages -- those two are not retrofitted, to avoid unrelated cleanup.
- One registry baseline moved: Capturing::choose's own body calls self.inner.choose(...), which the
  decision_delivery_inventory scanner correctly counts as a new choice.rs::choose site (2 -> 3).
  Updated rather than suppressed.
- No legal-set, option-ID, or application change; no features.rs change (OBS-008d reads this into
  features later).
- Checks: engine 1,170 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs; policy 201 + the 102-game deterministic
  campaign in 265.26 s (263.62 s for slice 1 -- no regression); training 133; strict Clippy and
  `cargo fmt --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-003E2.md`. **Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING**, alongside
  OBS-008c2b, the production-discount bug fix, OBS-008c3, OBS-003d, and OBS-003e slice 1 -- six
  packages now owed review.
- Next, per the plan's own recommended order: OBS-003f (trade), OBS-003g (agenda), OBS-003h
  (reaction/content, split by crate if >5 files), OBS-003i (prompt-free projection, after all typed
  context exists), then OBS-005/006, OBS-007c, before the OBS-008 decision-option packages.

---

## OBS-003e slice 1: strategy-card context producers (2026-09-04)

- Fourteen strategy_cards.rs producers, eighteen Choice sites, now attach typed DecisionContext:
  token gain/purchase, planet readying, Technology primary/secondary (same subtype
  research_technology, distinguished by the source's secondary flag), Jol-Nar's Specialist
  Compounds and Doctor Sucaban, Diplomacy, Politics (two distinct asks), the shared place_structure
  primitive, Trade, Warfare (recall plus redistribute), Imperial, and primary()'s two Thunder's Edge
  sites (te6warfare, te4construction), tagged Content(alias) rather than StrategyCard because the
  module's own header says they deliberately share printed names with materially different cards.
- No legal-set, option-ID, or application change; no features.rs change (typed-context foundation,
  per OBS-003e's own row -- OBS-008d reads it into features later).
- production/payment producers OBS-003e's row also names were already typed by OBS-008c1/c2a/c2b/c3.
  Turn (technology.rs's remaining reactive asks), token (tokens.rs) and scoring (objectives.rs,
  draft.rs, vote.rs) producers are explicitly deferred to a following slice, not silently claimed.
- Checks: engine 1,165 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs; policy 201 + the 102-game deterministic
  campaign in 263.62 s (264.29 s for OBS-003d -- no regression); training 133; strict Clippy and
  `cargo fmt --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-003E1.md`. **Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING**, alongside
  OBS-008c2b, the production-discount bug fix, OBS-008c3, and OBS-003d -- five packages now owed
  review.
- Next: OBS-003e slice 2 (turn/token/scoring producers), then OBS-003f-i, OBS-005/006, OBS-007c,
  before the OBS-008 decision-option packages that depend on them.

---

## OBS-003d tactical/combat context producers (2026-09-04)

- Thirteen producers across tactical.rs, combat.rs, invasion.rs, transit.rs and game.rs now attach
  typed DecisionContext (rule/content source, stable subtype, target where the decision has one):
  activation, movement, cargo loading, casualty assignment, dice reroll, sustain damage, Heart of
  the Ixth, retreat announce/destination, ground-force commitment, ground casualty, Dunlain Reaper
  deploy, bombardment target, next-ground-combat, custodians removal, and fighting a ground round.
- No legal-set, option-ID, or application change anywhere -- every existing test in the five files
  passed unmodified. No features.rs change: this package is the typed-context foundation, per its
  own row; reading these contexts into policy features is OBS-008a/008b's job.
- transit::CargoWindow gained phase/round fields, fixed once at for_ship construction, matching how
  the window already fixes player/origin there.
- Checks: engine 1,163 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs; policy 201 + the 102-game deterministic
  campaign in 264.29 s (266.63 s for c3 -- no regression); training 133; strict Clippy and
  `cargo fmt --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-003D.md`. **Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING**, alongside
  OBS-008c2b, the production-discount bug fix, and OBS-008c3 -- four packages now owed review.
- Next, per the plan's own recommended order: the remainder of OBS-003e (turn, strategy-card,
  technology beyond this session's production work, token, scoring producers -- production/payment
  producers are already typed from OBS-008c1/c2a/c2b/c3), then OBS-003f-i, OBS-005/006, OBS-007c,
  before the OBS-008 decision-option packages that depend on them.

---

## OBS-008c3 production discount surface (2026-09-04)

- Closes the `OBS-008c` row: build options' `discount` fact and AI Development Algorithm's own
  exhaust-or-not ask (typed subtype `exhaust_for_production_discount`, `discount_offered` fact) now
  reach the policy under the existing transferable `production` family.
- Harrugh Gefhara's ask stays unexposed: it has no invocation path in real play yet
  (`plans/BUG_2026-09-04_LEADER_USE_UNREACHABLE.md`), so there is no live choice to attach a feature
  to. Recorded as a boundary.
- Checks: engine 1,156 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs; policy 201 + the 102-game deterministic
  campaign in 266.63 s; training 133; strict Clippy and `cargo fmt --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-008C3.md`. **Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING.**
- `OBS-008c` is now complete: marginal build (`c2a`), limit/fleet/transport (`c2a`/`c2b`),
  debt/overpay (`c1`), and discount (`c3`). Payment-flexibility beyond `pay:option-count` was not
  separately deepened; not claimed as covered.
- Next ready package, per the plan's own recommended order (`STAGE2_COMPLETE_DECISION_CONTRACT.md`):
  `OBS-008d`, strategy/technology/scoring facts, or `OBS-007c` (stochastic preview foundation) before
  the combat-adjacent packages that depend on it. Not yet chosen.

## Bug fix: production discount unwired (Sarween Tools, AID, Harrugh) (2026-09-04)

- Found while scoping OBS-008c3: `GameState::production_discount_remaining` and
  `Player::free_production_use` were declared, typed and correctly initialized, with no writer and
  no reader anywhere. Every game a Sarween-Tools-owning faction (Jol-Nar, from the start) has ever
  played through this engine charged full printed price for every build.
- Fixed: `technology::production_used`, called from `game.rs::enter_production` at the same
  "when 1+ units use PRODUCTION" moment War Machine reacts to, grants Sarween Tools automatically
  and asks AI Development Algorithm's genuine exhaust-or-not choice. `ProductionWindow` now applies
  the discount to `cost` (offered to every option in a choice, spent only by the one resolved,
  mirroring `credit`); `printed_cost` is untouched. `production_seq` is now incremented, matching
  `activation_seq`'s existing pattern, so Harrugh Gefhara's marker check is meaningful.
- Not fixed, and separately recorded as larger: nothing in the driven game loop ever offers "use a
  leader" at all -- fifteen registered abilities across every implemented leader are unreachable.
  `plans/BUG_2026-09-04_LEADER_USE_UNREACHABLE.md`. Harrugh's *consumption* is proven correct by
  writing the marker directly into state; only the *invocation* is missing.
- Decisive test: `game::tests::sarween_tools_lowers_a_real_production_bill_in_a_driven_game` drives
  a real tactical action to completion twice through `Game`/`Table`/`Scripted`, with and without the
  tech, and asserts the live-offered cost differs by exactly one.
- Checks: engine 1,156 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs; policy 199 + the 102-game deterministic
  campaign in 307.50 s (305.41 s for c2b -- no regression); training 133; strict Clippy and
  `cargo fmt --check` clean.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/BUG_2026-09-04_PRODUCTION_DISCOUNT.md`.
  **Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING.**
- Next: `OBS-008c3`, exposing `cost`/`printed_cost`/`discount` (now meaningful) to the policy under
  the existing transferable `production` family.

## OBS-008c2b placement fleet and transport surface (2026-09-04)

- Active branch: `wp/obs-008c2b-placement-consequence-surface`, based on `3c5262e`
  (`OBS-008c2a` plus the milestone handover).
- `fleet::standing` is now the one arithmetic behind fleet supply and transport; `over_supply`,
  `over_capacity` and `fighters_over_capacity` go through it, and it optionally counts an `Arrival`
  that has not been placed. Agreement between a preview and the enforcement that removes units is
  therefore structural, and is proved by asking about an arrival and then placing it for real.
- Placement choices name Rule 68, their system, and both limits with what is already charged.
  Each option states its destination, the units that will actually arrive under 31.4, the capacity
  it consumes, the headroom and free capacity it leaves, and how many units enforcement would then
  remove -- with an analytic `FleetSupplyHeadroom`/`CapacityFree` preview.
- A build option whose destination is forced carries the same two quantities, which is the only way
  a ship's fleet-supply consequence is ever stated: a ship never reaches a placement question. An
  open destination states `placement_pending` and no fleet or transport quantity.
- Placement legality, option IDs/labels/set, payment application, replay behavior, choice identity
  and the point at which enforcement runs are unchanged.
- Checks: engine 1,145 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs; policy 199 + the 102-game deterministic
  campaign in 305.41 s (against 328.21 s for c2a -- no speedup claimed, single runs); training 133;
  strict all-target Clippy green; diff check green; formatting clean for every hunk this package
  added.
- Registry: `production.rs::placement_choice` added to the OBS-002a reviewed inventory and
  `pending_choice` dropped 3 -> 2, because the placement arm became its own method.
- Recorded residuals: c2a's preview used the purchased batch where `place` uses the clamped one
  (corrected; not reachable today because every two-for-one unit is uncapped); a sparse feature
  vector drops an exact zero, closed for these facts by `production:destination-known`; one planet
  destination is still not separated from another, which needs OBS-006/008a.
- **Independent Tier-C review OUTSTANDING.** Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-008C2B.md`.

---

## OBS-008c2a production-limit decision surface (2026-09-04)

- Active branch: `wp/obs-008c2a-production-limit-surface`, based on `4bdf247` (`OBS-008c1`).
- Production-unit choices now name Rule 68, their system, the full production limit and the amount
  already consumed. Each option exposes its bill/credit/yield and analytic remaining-limit plus
  Bellum Gloriosum allowance aftermath; policy receives bounded `production` facts.
- Production legality, payment application, option IDs/labels/set, replay behavior and choice
  identity remain unchanged. Fleet/transport final-placement consequences are deliberately held for
  `OBS-008c2b`.
- Checks: engine 1,141 lib + 4 integration + 5 docs; policy 198/198 (102-game deterministic
  campaign separately passed in 328.21 s); training 133; strict all-target Clippy green for engine
  and policy; diff check green. Workspace formatting has pre-existing unrelated drift and was not
  rewritten.
- Independent Tier-C review initially found two P2 coverage gaps (continued consumed-capacity
  context and non-certain preview states); both are now covered and rechecked **PASS / APPROVED**.
  Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-008C2A.md`.

### MLP policy branch — revision-5 plan review (2026-08-21)

- **Branch/HEAD before this review:** `codex/mlp-policy`, `851f8ad`.
- **Design note:** [`../docs/MLP_PLAN.md`](../docs/MLP_PLAN.md), revision 5. Section 11.2 is the
  dependency/permission/review map; exact package specifications are still required before each
  package starts.
- **Accepted compatibility policy:** by explicit operator decision on 2026-08-21, Python behavioral
  parity is no longer an acceptance criterion. `AGENTS.md` now treats the pinned Python repository
  as a read-only historical reference. Its pre-existing untracked
  `docs/POLICY_GRADIENT_HANDOVER.md` is recorded but does not block Rust implementation; no command
  may mutate or clean it.
- **Milestones reopened:** M06 (rules), M07/M08 (downstream reaffirmation), M09 (learned policy),
  and M10 (training). Each has a new exit review after its added packages.

**M06-021 status: implemented, reviewed, NOT accepted.** The independent tier C review is recorded
in [`evidence/M06-021.md`](evidence/M06-021.md). Official FFG Living Rules Reference 2.0 rule 61.7
permits scoring in both space and ground combat in one tactical action; the merged turn-scoped
window can offer only once at `advance_turn`. Become a Martyr is also represented as a later board
position rather than a control-loss occurrence. M06-021a must resolve both findings and pass a
fresh tier C review. The existing 1274-pass workspace result and 150-game report remain historical
evidence, not acceptance.

**Next ready package after this docs-only review is committed:** M06-021a1 — occurrence model and
event-scoring semantics, the first child of the event-scoped secret timing correction. It is P1,
tier C, and must receive an exact task specification before code. M06-021a2 completes emitter
wiring and the parent review; M06-022 and all later work remain dependency-blocked behind it. After
M06-024, M07-019/020 and
M08-018/019 formally reaffirm downstream gates before M09 begins.

**Plan-review decisions now closed:** canonical option-free critic features; shared readout plus
zero-init faction residuals; post-feature deterministic vocabulary with fixed physical capacity;
schema-6 inference vs training-resume split; exact payment-planner progress; CPU-authoritative
rollouts and optional CUDA optimizer only; fixed distillation/DAgger seed clusters; validation/final
data separation; bounded durable baseline fixtures; three independently trained ablations; and
reopened M06–M10 exit reviews. The final consistency pass also made milestone dependencies explicit,
added the actor/critic vectors and returns required of the teacher corpus, forbade intermediate
promotion/early stopping in optimizer pilots, fixed the promotion variance audit as diagnostic-only,
and superseded M00's former behavioral-oracle wording.

## M06-021a1 implementation checkpoint (2026-08-21)

- **Active milestone/package:** M06 / M06-021a1 — occurrence model and event-scoring semantics.
  The parent M06-021a was split before code because its model/scoring and emitter/pause-point work
  exceed the atomic-package limit. Emitter wiring was then split again: M06-021a2a owns tactical
  combat pauses, followed by M06-021a2b for the remaining emitters and parent review.
- **Branch/HEAD:** `wp/m06-021a-event-scoped-secret-timing` at `92edea4` before this package's
  uncommitted scoped implementation.
- **Implemented and verified:** `FeatOccurrence`, deterministic event-feat recording and exact
  occurrence matching; `EventScope`; combat one-score cap; action/agenda sequential scoring; and
  decline closure. The parent is deliberately still unresolved: no production emitter allocates an
  occurrence yet, so no actual game timing is claimed fixed.
- **Checks:** five focused tests passed; `cargo test -p ti4-model` (73), `cargo test -p
  ti4-engine` (806 plus 5 doctests), and `cargo test --workspace` (exit 0; the 30.2-second tool
  call also ran the scoped formatter) passed.
  `ti4-model` Clippy passed under `-D warnings`; engine Clippy completed with only the documented
  pre-existing warnings. `git diff --check` passed. Evidence:
  [`evidence/M06-021a1.md`](evidence/M06-021a1.md).
- **Review/commit status:** no independent Tier-C review has occurred and no package commit has
  been made. The M06-021a2 parent integration review must cover this child and resolve all findings
  before acceptance.
- **Intentional working-tree paths:** `crates/ti4-model/src/state.rs`,
  `crates/ti4-engine/src/secrets.rs`, `crates/ti4-engine/src/objectives.rs`,
  `plans/M06-021a_EVENT_SCOPED_SECRET_TIMING.md`, `plans/evidence/M06-021a1.md`,
  `plans/EXECUTION_STATE.md`, `plans/M06_GENERAL_RULES.md`, and `docs/MLP_PLAN.md`.
- **Next exact action:** implement only M06-021a2a's tactical event pauses. M06-021a2b owns the
  remaining emitters and the parent Tier-C review. Investigation recorded in
  [`evidence/M06-021a2a.md`](evidence/M06-021a2a.md): the pause must be an atomic
  cross-window state-machine change, not an isolated feat-emitter edit.

**Historical docs-only plan-review working tree before commit `92edea4`:** `AGENTS.md`,
`docs/MLP_PLAN.md`, `plans/MASTER_PLAN.md`, `plans/INDEX.md`, `plans/SCOPED_PERMISSIONS.md`,
`plans/EXECUTION_STATE.md`, `plans/M00_ORACLE_AND_BASELINE.md`,
`plans/PI_WORK_PACKAGE_STANDARD.md`,
`plans/M06_GENERAL_RULES.md`, `plans/M07_FACTIONS_AND_TE.md`, `plans/M08_AUTHORED_BOTS.md`,
`plans/M09_LEARNED_POLICY.md`, `plans/M10_SIMULATION_AND_TRAINING.md`,
`plans/M12_QUALIFICATION.md`, `plans/M13_CUTOVER.md`, `plans/evidence/M06-021.md`, and
`plans/evidence/MLP-ARTIFACTS.md`. No source code, generated artifact, or historical Python
repository path was modified. Validation passed: Markdown table and local-link scan; stale-term and
dependency-reference scan; 31-row package-map reconciliation; `git diff --check`; and all four
baseline artifact hashes/sizes. The read-only historical repository remains at
`37061c511a4780d4c0719e0342533a498cd4b457` on `codex/fully-learned-policy`, with only its pre-existing
untracked `docs/POLICY_GRADIENT_HANDOVER.md`. Cargo tests were not run because the changes are
documentation-only.

Baseline hashes remain in [`evidence/MLP-ARTIFACTS.md`](evidence/MLP-ARTIFACTS.md). The two
non-reproducible checkpoints are not durable yet; M09-020 is a hard prerequisite for corpus capture.

## M06-021a2 integration checkpoint (2026-08-21)

- **Active milestone/package:** M06 / M06-021a2b accepted. Occurrence semantics, tactical pauses,
  and all remaining production emitters are implemented. The independent parent Tier-C review is
  complete; F7-F10 are resolved and the full gates pass.
- **Branch/HEAD:** `wp/m06-021a-event-scoped-secret-timing` at base `92edea4`, with the complete
  a1/a2a/a2b integration intentionally uncommitted until review disposition.
- **Implemented:** persistent one-score-per-combat occurrence; exact space-cannon, barrage,
  space-combat, bombardment, per-planet ground-combat, home-control-loss, last-pass, and per-agenda
  occurrences; sequential unlimited non-combat scoring; exact election attribution; failed-secret
  award guard; removal of the legacy turn feat/event path; resumable stepped and synchronous combat
  and invasion drivers.
- **Checks:** focused timing regressions pass; `ti4-model` 73; `ti4-engine` 819 plus 5 doctests;
  `cargo test --workspace --quiet` exit 0; strict model Clippy passes; engine Clippy passes after
  fixing its only new warning, retaining only documented pre-existing warnings; `git diff --check`
  passes with the existing objectives.rs CRLF advisory.
- **Post-gate audit fixes:** space-cannon scoring now precedes combat opening; agenda scoring now
  precedes the next reveal; direct combat/invasion wrappers resume across internal pauses; event
  helpers require concrete occurrences; invalid occurrence scoring is proven atomic; last-pass
  occurrence replay is deterministic.
- **Review findings:** the reviewer independently verified F1-F6 and raised F7-F10. F7 now binds
  Become a Martyr only to its home-loss occurrence; F8 shares rival-home semantics across combat
  types; F9 shares one tactical-start note snapshot; F10 extracts the ground-round resolver. All
  fixes pass focused and workspace gates. F11 is informational and non-blocking.
- **Intentional paths:** `crates/ti4-model/src/state.rs`, `crates/ti4-engine/src/{combat,game,
  invasion,objectives,secrets}.rs`, `docs/MLP_PLAN.md`, `plans/M06_GENERAL_RULES.md`, the M06-021a
  package specifications/review ledger/evidence files, and this execution state.
- **Next exact action:** commit the accepted correction, then begin M06-022 from its exact package
  specification.
- **Safe follow-on preparation:** `M06-022_COUNTING_OBJECTIVE_PROGRESS.md` now contains the exact
  34-alias family/threshold API, scope, invariants, and acceptance-test plan. Its M06-021a
  dependency is now accepted. No M06-022 source was changed yet.
- `M06-023_BESPOKE_AND_BOUGHT_PROGRESS.md` is likewise prepared without source changes. It fixes
  the six distinct-count definitions and the greatest-exactly-affordable `k` contract for all ten
  costs, including disjoint `AllThree` payment properties; it remains blocked behind accepted
  M06-022.
- **Current next action:** commit the accepted M06-021a correction, then create the M06-022 package
  branch and implement its exact counting-family progress specification.

## M06-022 implementation checkpoint (2026-08-21)

- **Active milestone/package:** M06 / M06-022 — counting-family objective progress.
- **Branch/base:** `wp/m06-022-counting-objective-progress` / accepted M06-021a commit `5d027e8`.
- **Status:** accepted after independent Claude Opus 5 Tier-B review. All mapping, legality,
  determinism, purity, and behavior-preservation checks passed; G1-G3 are resolved.
- **Implemented:** typed stable family identity and exact raw `have`/`threshold` progress for all
  24 public and 10 secret aliases; affected legality derives from that same progress; outer-rim
  counts are unavailable without a map; exact maximum/distinct reductions and immutable queries.
- **Checks:** engine 822 unit tests plus 5 doctests; workspace exit 0; engine Clippy has no new
  warning after fixing the package-local boolean simplification; `git diff --check` passes.
- **Intentional paths:** `crates/ti4-engine/src/objectives.rs`, `secrets.rs`, M06-022 spec/evidence/
  review ledger, and this execution state. M06-023 and M06-024 specs remain uncommitted preparation.
- **Next exact action:** commit M06-022, then create the M06-023 package branch and implement its
  expanded 33-alias remaining-position/exact-bought-cost specification.
- **Dependency-safe preparation completed while review is pending:** M06-023 now names all ten
  bought-objective aliases/cost families/targets explicitly; M06-024 has an exact frontier-review
  specification; M07-019/M07-020 and M08-018/M08-019 now have scoped revalidation/review
  specifications. None of their source implementation has started or bypassed its dependency.

## M06-023 implementation checkpoint (2026-08-21)

- **Active milestone/package:** M06 / M06-023 — remaining position and exact bought-cost objective
  progress.
- **Branch/base:** `wp/m06-023-remaining-objective-progress` / accepted M06-022 commit `d58622c`.
- **Status:** accepted after independent Claude Opus 5 Tier-C review. H1's production-format
  promissory-note lookup is fixed through `promissory::alias_of`, its test uses a real note key, and
  H2's misleading helper name is corrected. The package is ready to commit.
- **Implemented:** exact typed progress for six public and seventeen secret position families;
  greatest exactly-affordable scaled progress for all ten bought objectives; legality derived from
  or proven equivalent to the same predicate/payment path; unavailable map state preserved.
- **Checks:** focused mappings/unavailable cases pass; bounded exhaustive affordability campaign
  covers 1,792 states x ten costs plus all 64 small token-pool splits; engine 832 plus 5 doctests;
  full workspace exit 0; engine Clippy
  has no package-local warning; `git diff --check` passes.
- **Intentional active-package paths:** `crates/ti4-engine/src/objectives.rs`, `secrets.rs`,
  `plans/M06-023_BESPOKE_AND_BOUGHT_PROGRESS.md`, `plans/evidence/M06-023.md`,
  `plans/M06-023_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`, and this execution state.
- **Preserved dependency-safe preparation:** M06-024, M07-019/020, and M08-018/019 specifications
  remain untracked and uncommitted; they contain no source implementation and do not bypass gates.
  Their path audit corrected stale nonexistent `ti4-policy/src/authored.rs` references to `bot.rs`,
  tightened review packages to read-only source access before a documented finding, and fixed the
  future M06 review base to exact commit `92edea4` with accepted additions `5d027e8`/`d58622c`.
- **Next exact action:** rerun the final workspace/Clippy gates, commit only M06-023 scoped paths,
  create the M06-024 review branch, and begin its exact committed-frontier campaign. The related
  pre-existing Betray-a-Friend note-owner emitter defect is a named blocking M06-024 input.

## M06-024 reopened-frontier review checkpoint (2026-08-21)

- **Active milestone/package:** M06 / M06-024 — reopened M06 exit review over `92edea4..bfcdb73`.
- **Branch/base:** `wp/m06-024-reopened-frontier-review` from accepted M06-023 commit `bfcdb73`.
- **Status:** implementation work complete; **independent frontier adjudication pending** (Tier-C
  requires a reviewer distinct from any implementer of the reviewed code). Not accepted, not
  committed.
- **F1 (carried blocking finding): resolved.** `combat.rs::note_holdings` built note issuers with
  `PlayerId::new(faction_name)`, so faction-note Betray-a-Friend issuers could never match; both
  space and ground emitters share that snapshot. Fix resolves through
  `promissory::owner_of` + `promissory::seat_of`; unseated owners yield no issuer. Four regression
  tests (two unit, one per combat path) verified red-before/green-after. Defect-class sweep found
  no other occurrence (`laws.rs::repeal` stores player ids — correct).
- **F2 (new blocking finding): escalated to M06-025.** baf and sb print a play-area restriction the
  engine does not enforce; face-up model hard-codes `an`/`convoys` while the accepted corpus marks
  eleven notes `playArea: true` (eight faction notes uncovered, incl. Terraform). Spec written at
  `plans/M06-025_PLAY_AREA_NOTE_SCORING.md`. **Blocks the M06 exit gate until accepted.**
- **Checks:** nine named focused tests from M06-021a/022/023 pass; exhaustive payment campaigns
  (`bought_progress_is_maximal_across_bounded_small_states`, `token_progress_is_exact_across_all_
  small_pool_splits`) pass; engine 835 + 5 doctests; workspace 18 suites / 1,308 passed / 0 failed,
  deterministic across two runs (timing stripped); ti4-model Clippy clean; engine Clippy shows only
  the three documented pre-existing warnings (one package-introduced redundant-closure warning was
  fixed); both touched source files rustfmt-clean under edition 2024 with hunks confined to
  `note_holdings` and test modules; workspace-wide `cargo fmt --all --check` drift proven
  pre-existing at base `bfcdb73`; `git diff --check` clean.
- **Intentional active-package paths:** `crates/ti4-engine/src/combat.rs`,
  `crates/ti4-engine/src/invasion.rs`, `plans/M06-024_REOPENED_FRONTIER_REVIEW.md`,
  `plans/M06-024_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`, `plans/evidence/M06-024.md`, and this execution state.
- **Preserved dependency-safe preparation:** M06-025 spec (new), M07-019/020, M08-018/019 specs
  remain untracked; no source implementation started for any of them.
- **Next exact action:** obtain the independent frontier review of `plans/M06-024_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`
  (recheck F1 fix + four regression tests, confirm F2 escalation is correctly scoped). If accepted:
  commit only M06-024 scoped paths on this branch, then start M06-025 from the accepted head. The
  M06 exit gate stays closed until M06-025 is also accepted.

## M06-025 play-area note scoring checkpoint (2026-08-21)

- **Active milestone/package:** M06 / M06-025 — play-area note scoring for baf and sb (F2 fix).
- **Branch/base:** `wp/m06-025-play-area-note-scoring` from accepted head `bfcdb73`; the verified
  M06-024 F1 fix is carried in the working tree and commits first at closure.
- **Status:** **accepted** by independent Tier-C review (Claude Opus 5,
  `plans/M06-025_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`; reviewer implemented none of the code under review).
  Findings: L1 recorded in evidence with a standing re-check condition for any future roster
  widening; L2 recorded in M06-023 evidence (the 91% sb figure was counting hand-held notes);
  L3 resolved by comment at `combat.rs::note_holdings`. Committed together with M06-024 — see
  closure record below.
- **M06-024 adjudication landed the same day** (Claude Opus 5, recorded in
  `plans/M06-024_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`): F1 accept; F2 confirmed and correctly escalated to this
  package; M06-024 not acceptable until M06-025 lands plus J1's instrumentation run.
- **J1 (adjudicator's required action) resolved.** New probe
  `crates/ti4-training/examples/feat_activation_probe.rs` (declared writable in the M06-024 ledger)
  ran one 150-game panel (25 seeds × 6 rotations, r6 champions at
  `out/stage2_r6/final10000.json`, holdout map pool): BarrageTookTheLastFighters recorded **21**
  times / fwp scored **0**; WonAgainstANoteHolder recorded **313** / baf scored **11** (same count
  the adjudicator measured independently — baf is live end-to-end); LostAHomePlanet recorded **48**
  / bam scored **0**. Zero feat+card co-occurrence at game end for fwp/bam is statistically
  consistent with rare alignment (expected overlap ≈1.4 and ≈1.8; P(0)≈23%/15%); the full scoring
  loops are proven by unit tests (`game.rs::barrage_scoring_pauses_combat_and_caps_the_whole_
combat_occurrence`, secrets/invasion occurrence tests). None of the three mechanisms is
  unreachable. Residual mid-game-hand uncertainty recorded with its closing method; supersedes and
  closes F11 from the M06-021a ledger. Mean VP per seat on this post-M06-025 run: **2.958**
  (adjudicator's pre-M06-025 J2 baseline was 2.935).
- **Implementation:** content-driven face-up model `promissory::is_play_area` over the corpus
  `playArea` field (generic `<color>` records apply under every owner; faction records bind to
  their owner); baf filter in `combat.rs::note_holdings`; sb filter in
  `secrets.rs::rival_note_issuers_count` plus K1 fix (issuer from the note key via `owner_of`,
  which the old record-by-alias lookup missed for every generic note). Scope extension declared:
  `transactions.rs` signature threading only. Four new tests; two existing tests rebuilt on
  production-valid keys.
- **Red-first:** with only the two filter lines removed, both decision-boundary tests fail
  (`note_holdings_resolves_production_note_keys_to_seated_issuers`,
  `strengthening_bonds_counts_only_play_area_notes`); restored → green. The combat test was
  strengthened mid-verification because its first draft was insensitive to the mutant (BTreeSet
  dedup hid a same-issuer hand-held note).
- **Checks:** eight focused tests pass individually; engine **839 + 5 doctests**; workspace
  **18 suites / 1,312 passed / 0 failed**, deterministic across two runs (timing stripped);
  Clippy: zero warnings in any touched file (only the three documented pre-existing engine
  warnings elsewhere); all six touched Rust files rustfmt-clean under edition 2024; `git diff
  --check` clean. Probe example clippy/fmt clean, output deterministic across runs.
- **Intentional active-package paths:** `crates/ti4-engine/src/{promissory,combat,secrets,
  invasion,transactions}.rs`, `crates/ti4-training/examples/feat_activation_probe.rs` (J1,
  belongs to M06-024 acceptance), `plans/M06-025_PLAY_AREA_NOTE_SCORING.md`,
  `plans/evidence/M06-025.md`, plus the M06-024 paths above and this execution state.
- **Behavior change recorded:** baf/sb now count play-area notes only; downstream VP/clearance
  numbers non-comparable until re-baselined (see `plans/evidence/M06-025.md`).
- **M06 closure (same day):** with M06-025 accepted, F2 clears. M06-024's adjudication conditions
  are all met (F1 accept; J1 run recorded; independence limitation recorded), so M06-024 is
  acceptable too (`plans/M06-024_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md` §Final acceptance). Both packages commit as
  one closure commit on this branch — a per-package split was impossible: both fixes live in the
  same if-chain in `combat.rs::note_holdings`, and M06-024's rebuilt invasion test depends on
  M06-025's `take()` signature, so no intermediate state compiles. The commit message attributes
  each package explicitly.
- **M06 exit gate: CLOSED.** Closure record in `plans/M06_GENERAL_RULES.md` (exit gate section):
  final verification engine 839 + 5 doctests; workspace 18 suites / 1,312 passed / 0 failed,
  deterministic across two runs; exhaustive payment campaigns pass; Clippy clean on all touched
  files; rustfmt and `git diff --check` clean. Independence limitation carried into the closure
  record per the adjudicator's instruction. Known-difference ledger: baf/sb play-area semantics
  change downstream VP/clearance comparability (re-baseline before citing old numbers); eight
  faction play-area notes untestable under D11's roster until a future package widens it.
- **Next exact action:** M07-019 — post-M06 faction/TE integration revalidation (spec prepared at
  `plans/M07-019_POST_M06_REVALIDATION.md`; dependencies met: M06-024 accepted, M07-018 part of
  the accepted M07 baseline). Create its package branch from this closure commit and follow the
  standard package loop.

## Checkpoint — M07-019 accepted, corrections applied, commit pending (2026-08-22)

- **Active milestone/package:** M07 / M07-019 (post-M06 faction/TE integration revalidation).
- **Branch and HEAD:** `wp/m07-019-post-m06-revalidation` from closure commit `b721a9a`; no package
  commit yet — independent Tier B review is in, all corrections applied; the scoped commit follows.
- **Working tree (active-package paths):** `crates/ti4-engine/src/game.rs` (+588/−0, test module
  only), `plans/evidence/M07-019.md` (new), `plans/M07-019_POST_M06_REVALIDATION.md` (spec,
  untracked→accepted status), `plans/M07-019_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md` (review + resolution, new),
  `plans/M07_FACTIONS_AND_TE.md` (M07-021 row added to the work-package table), and this file.
  Pre-existing unrelated changes preserved untouched: `AGENTS.md`, `plans/PI_WORK_PACKAGE_STANDARD.md`,
  `plans/M06-025_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md` (operator-directed toolchain note, pre-dating this package)
  and the untracked M07-020 / M08-018 / M08-019 prep specs.
- **What was done:** four nested-window regression tests in `game.rs` pinning faction/TE effects
  across M06 event-scoped scoring pauses: (1) Munitions Reserves marker survives the fwp barrage
  pause, round-2 offer declined rather than inherited; (2) home-loss pause holds the invasion at
  FinalizingControl — occurrences in Game-level order, control transferred pre-pause, exactly-once
  capture (conversion assertions documented as vacuous until F-M07-019-1 is fixed); (3) Flank Speed
  expires by activation-sequence identity across the pause; (4) TE breakthrough + slice + Gravleash
  anchor survive the combat scoring pause. No demonstrated M06 regression required a source fix.
- **Independent Tier B review (Claude Opus 5, `plans/M07-019_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`): ACCEPT** with
  one required correction (M1) — all applied and recorded in its Resolution section: M1(a) evidence
  corrected (conversion assertions vacuous under current behavior), M1(b) test renamed to
  `the_home_loss_pause_holds_the_invasion_at_finalizing_control`, M1(c) Assimilate-after-pause
  coverage added as a required deliverable of the F-M07-019-1 fix package. Reviewer independently
  mutation-confirmed tests 1 and 3 as load-bearing across the pause; confirmed both findings.
- **Findings (recorded, not fixed):** F-M07-019-1 structures count as ground defenders in
  `invasion.rs::defender_on` (official LRR: planet falls without resistance absent enemy ground
  forces; pre-dates M06; changes invasion legality/timing semantics → frontier adjudication required
  before any fix package). F-M07-019-2 phantom round rolls after a total-wipe fwp pause (dice-stream
  position only — reviewer confirmed round identity/events/ability offers cannot diverge because they
  live inside the `if run_barrage` block; minor, known-difference ledger entry warranted). F-M07-019-3
  (review M2) `Player.event_feats` missing from state equality → **scoped as child package M07-021**
  (prep spec written; milestone-plan row added with hard ordering: must complete before M07-020).
- **Tests last run and exact results:** four tests pass individually under final names; engine
  **843 + 5 doctests**; workspace **1,316 / 0** (post-correction run; the pre-correction determinism
  pair stands for the unchanged test bodies); replay suite 4/4 and registry suite 8/8 at first pass.
- **Checks:** Clippy zero warnings in added code (two new too-many-lines sites from the reviewer's
  first pass resolved with targeted `#[allow]` + reason per M3; only the three documented pre-
  existing crate-wide warnings remain); game.rs rustfmt-clean under edition 2024; `git diff --check`
  clean.
- **Decisions:** test-only package — findings escalated rather than fixed because their fix paths
  (`invasion.rs`, `combat.rs`, `ti4-model`) are outside this package's writable declarations;
  M3 resolved with local lint allows (codebase precedent) rather than splitting tests; M2 scoped as
  child rather than deferred silently. Redaction invariant holds by construction (M4 informational:
  no leak today, nothing pins the judgement — recorded).
- **Open review findings or blockers:** none open from Tier B. F-M07-019-1 awaits frontier
  adjudication before its fix package is scoped; M07-021 is ready to schedule.
- **Next exact action:** commit the scoped paths on `wp/m07-019-post-m06-revalidation` (game.rs,
  evidence, spec, review items + resolution, milestone-plan row, this file); then M07-021
  (`event_feats` projection) before M07-020's exit review.

## Checkpoint — M07-021 accepted, review resolutions applied, commit pending (2026-08-22)

- **Active milestone/package:** M07 / M07-021 (`event_feats` state-equality projection; child of
  M07-019 review finding M2 / F-M07-019-3).
- **Branch and HEAD:** `wp/m07-021-event-feats-projection` from `c034549`; no package commit yet —
  independent Tier B review is in (accept), resolutions applied; the scoped commit follows.
- **Working tree (active-package paths):** `crates/ti4-model/src/state.rs` (+4 compared-field line
  with rationale, +1 focused test), `crates/ti4-engine/src/combat.rs` (test module only: completed
  the stepped harness of `a_stepped_combat_matches_the_driven_one`, +17/−1),
  `plans/evidence/M07-021.md` (new, incl. N1 coverage limit + N2 disposition),
  `plans/M07-021_EVENT_FEATS_PROJECTION.md` (accepted status + scope-extension declaration),
  `plans/M07-021_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md` (review + resolution, new),
  `plans/M07_FACTIONS_AND_TE.md` (M07-022 row; M07-020 now depends on 019/021/022),
  `plans/M07-022_STEPPED_EQUIVALENCE_ACROSS_PAUSES.md` (new prep spec, commits with its parent per
  the M06-025 precedent), and this file. Pre-existing unrelated changes preserved untouched:
  `AGENTS.md`, `plans/PI_WORK_PACKAGE_STANDARD.md`, `plans/M06-025_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md` and the
  untracked M07-020 / M08-018 / M08-019 prep specs.
- **What was done:** Option A implemented — `Player::PartialEq` now compares `event_feats`, closing
  the projection gap where two states differing only in feat evidence compared equal. Red-first:
  the focused test failed before the one-line fix (states compared equal) and passes after.
- **Exposed dependence diagnosed, not fixture-regenerated:** the change turned
  `a_stepped_combat_matches_the_driven_one` red because its stepped harness omitted the post-combat
  feat bookkeeping both real drivers perform (`before_combat` snapshot +
  `note_combat_event_feats` at completion — game.rs:279–286, combat.rs:1489–1495); in that fixture
  the driven side recorded `HeldThreeShipsAfterASpaceCombat`. The harness now mirrors both drivers;
  no assertion changed. This is exactly the detection-latency scenario M2 predicted.
- **Scope extension declared:** `crates/ti4-engine/src/combat.rs` (test module only) was outside
  the original writable declaration; required because the failing harness lives there and no
  in-scope path can make the comparison faithful otherwise. Declared in the spec per the M06-025
  precedent; reviewer to adjudicate.
- **Tests last run and exact results:** focused test red-before/green-after; model **74 / 0** (was
  73, +1 new test); engine **843 / 0** (unchanged count); workspace **1,317 / 0**, identical across
  two runs (deterministic).
- **Checks:** Clippy zero warnings in ti4-model and no new warnings in combat.rs (only the three
  documented pre-existing engine warnings remain crate-wide); both touched Rust files rustfmt-clean
  under edition 2024; `git diff --check` clean.
- **Decisions:** Option A over B — no concrete contract breaks (full workspace green), and the
  field was never in the oracle-exclusion list nor marked `// Not compared.`. Behavior change is
  strictly stricter equality: equivalence/replay comparisons catch more, never fewer; no scoring,
  replay-hash projection, choice ID, or registry changed.
- **Independent Tier B review (Claude Opus 5): ACCEPT.** Scope extension into `combat.rs`
  approved as a genuine test-only completion (reviewer verified both production consumers already
  perform the bookkeeping; red-first and the exposed dependence reproduced independently).
- **Review resolutions applied:** N1 — coverage limit recorded in evidence (the invariant holds on
  `event_feats` for fights that do not pause; earlier wording retracted as overstatement) and
  follow-up scoped as **M07-022** before the exit review, now a dependency of M07-020. N2 —
  disposition recorded: helper factoring adopted into M07-022; Game-level re-pointing deferred to
  M07-020's scope decision (including the deliberate `before_combat_with_notes` vs `before_combat`
  snapshot difference).
- **Open review findings or blockers:** none open from Tier B. M07-022 is ready to schedule.
- **Next exact action:** commit the scoped paths on `wp/m07-021-event-feats-projection` (state.rs,
  combat.rs, evidence, both specs, review items + resolution, milestone-plan rows, this file); then
  M07-022 (stepped equivalence across pauses) before M07-020's exit review.
- **M07-021 committed as `5241f2d`** on `wp/m07-021-event-feats-projection` (8 files, +473/−10).

## Checkpoint — M07-022 accepted, review resolutions applied, commit pending (2026-08-22)

- **Active milestone/package:** M07 / M07-022 (stepped-vs-driven equivalence across scoring pauses;
  child of the M07-021 review finding N1; dependency of the M07-020 exit review).
- **Branch and HEAD:** `wp/m07-022-stepped-equivalence-across-pauses` from `5241f2d`; no package
  commit yet — independent Tier B review is in (accept), resolutions applied; the scoped commit
  follows.
- **Working tree (active-package paths):** `crates/ti4-engine/src/combat.rs` only (+1 new test with
  an explicit both-sides feat assertion; +1 production helper `complete_window` with a
  behavior-preserving refactor of `resolve()`'s tail; +1 shared stepped harness `stepped_fight`
  with pause consumption, replacing the two inline stepped branches; P1 backtick fix in the
  harness doc comment), `plans/evidence/M07-022.md` (new, incl. pasted Clippy output per P1,
  P2 coverage limit, P3 note), `plans/M07-022_STEPPED_EQUIVALENCE_ACROSS_PAUSES.md` (accepted
  status), `plans/M07-022_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md` (review + resolution, new),
  `plans/M07_FACTIONS_AND_TE.md` (M07-023 row; M07-020 now depends on 019/021/022/023),
  `plans/M07-023_POST_PAUSE_CHOICE_COMPOSITION.md` (new prep spec, commits with its parent per the
  M06-025 precedent), and this file. Pre-existing unrelated changes preserved untouched:
  `AGENTS.md`, `plans/PI_WORK_PACKAGE_STANDARD.md`,
  `plans/M06-025_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md` and the untracked M07-020 / M08-018 / M08-019 prep specs.
- **Red-first:** new test written first against the current (M07-021) harness shape — FAILED with a
  panic at `.expect("the fight resolved")` (combat.rs:2791), reproducing reviewer N1's probe
  exactly; green after pause consumption was added.
- **N2 factorization landed:** `complete_window` is now the single completion-bookkeeping path for
  both `resolve()` and the stepped harness — a third copy is structurally impossible. The Game
  driver keeps its own inline bookkeeping (a noted occurrence pauses there before the fight is
  over); documented in the helper's doc comment.
- **Verification:** engine **844 + 5 doctests** (+1 = new test; `resolve()` refactor changed no
  behavior); workspace **1,318 / 0 identical across two runs**; Clippy — no new warnings (only the
  two documented pre-existing engine warnings remain); combat.rs rustfmt-clean under edition 2024;
  `git diff --check` clean.
- **Independent Tier B review (Claude Opus 5): ACCEPT.** Reviewer reproduced the red-first claim
  exactly (probe: pause branch → `break` reproduces the panic; reverted), verified the
  `complete_window` refactor line-for-line behavior-preserving, and confirmed the chain closes:
  `GameState::identical` opens with `self == other`, so M07-021's `Player::PartialEq` addition does
  feed these tests' assertions.
- **Review resolutions applied:** P1 (required) — backticks added at the site; evidence now pastes
  the tool's actual Clippy output (three pre-existing warnings, zero new); post-fix re-verification
  recorded (engine 844 + 5 doctests; workspace 1,318 / 0). P2 — successor scoped as **M07-023**
  before the exit review (pause→choice composition: pausing fixture that continues into a casualty
  assignment), now a dependency of M07-020; evidence framing corrected to "across a scoring pause
  with no choice after it". P3 — recorded: sharing `complete_window` removed the last independent
  check on its content; green equivalence must not be cited as validating bookkeeping content
  (`a_driven_combat_continues_after_its_barrage_scoring_pause` does that).
- **Open review findings or blockers:** none open from Tier B. M07-023 is ready to schedule.
- **Next exact action:** commit the scoped paths on `wp/m07-022-stepped-equivalence-across-pauses`
  (combat.rs, evidence, both specs, review items + resolution, milestone-plan rows, this file);
  then M07-023 (pause→choice composition) before M07-020's exit review.
- **M07-022 committed as `7f357b6`** on `wp/m07-022-stepped-equivalence-across-pauses`
  (7 files, +568/−46).

## Checkpoint — M07-023 accepted, review resolutions applied, commit pending (2026-08-22)

- **Active milestone/package:** M07 / M07-023 (stepped equivalence across pause→choice resumption;
  child of the M07-022 review finding P2; dependency of the M07-020 exit review).
- **Branch and HEAD:** `wp/m07-023-post-pause-choice-composition` from `7f357b6`; no package commit
  yet — independent Tier B review is in (accept), resolutions applied; the scoped commit follows.
- **Working tree (active-package paths):** `crates/ti4-engine/src/combat.rs` (**test module only**,
  +104/−15: one new test `a_stepped_combat_matches_the_driven_one_across_a_pause_and_assignment`
  — pausing fixture that continues into a casualty-assignment choice at the retained frame, with
  log-based non-vacuity assertions; plus Q1/Q2 hardening in `stepped_fight`: it now returns
  `(CombatOutcome, Option<usize>)` measuring asks-before-first-pause and asserts its context table
  stayed unasked), `plans/evidence/M07-023.md` (new, incl. review resolutions + pasted Clippy
  output), `plans/M07-023_POST_PAUSE_CHOICE_COMPOSITION.md` (accepted status),
  `plans/M07-023_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md` (review + resolution, new), and this file. Pre-existing
  unrelated changes preserved untouched: `AGENTS.md`, `plans/PI_WORK_PACKAGE_STANDARD.md`,
  `plans/M06-025_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md` and the untracked M07-020 / M08-018 / M08-019 prep specs.
- **Non-vacuity probe (deliverable 2b):** with `stepped_fight`'s no-choice branch replaced by
  `break` (pre-M07-022 shape), the new test FAILED at `.expect("the fight resolved")`
  (combat.rs:2739) — proving the fixture really pauses; M07-022's pausing test failed under the
  same probe, and the non-pausing test stayed green. Probe reverted; all three re-run green.
- **Verification:** engine **845 + 5 doctests** (+1 = new test); workspace **1,319 / 0 identical
  across two runs**; Clippy — pasted output in evidence (three pre-existing warnings, zero new);
  combat.rs rustfmt-clean (no changes needed to this package's additions); `git diff --check`
  clean.
- **Independent Tier B review (Claude Opus 5): ACCEPT.** Reviewer measured the composition
  directly (instrumented branch order: PAUSE-BRANCH then CHOICE "assign a hit"), reproduced the
  non-vacuity probe exactly, and confirmed the Clippy claim is correct for the first time in this
  chain — pasting tool output worked.
- **Review resolutions applied (inside this package, per disposition — no M07-024 spawned):**
  Q1 — pause ordering now asserted: `stepped_fight` returns asks-before-first-pause and the test
  asserts `Some(0)` (fixture pauses; no choice may precede the barrage). Q2 — log-comparison
  integrity guarded: `stepped_fight` asserts its context table stayed unasked; the stale "neither
  is asserted on" comment corrected at the site.
- **Post-resolution re-verification:** all three equivalence tests ok; engine **845 + 5 doctests**
  (count unchanged); workspace **1,319 / 0 identical ×2**; Clippy — same pasted output as the
  review's own run (three pre-existing warnings, zero new); combat.rs rustfmt-clean;
  `git diff --check` clean.
- **Open review findings or blockers:** none open from Tier B. The M07-019→023 chain is closed per
  the reviewer's instruction; remaining harness-fidelity questions go to M07-020's known-limits
  ledger for one-time adjudication.
- **Next exact action:** commit the scoped paths on `wp/m07-023-post-pause-choice-composition`
  (combat.rs, evidence, spec, review items + resolution, this file); then M07-020 — all four
  dependencies (M07-019, M07-021, M07-022, M07-023) met, opening the milestone's reopened frontier
  exit review.

## Checkpoint — M07-020 campaign complete, independent Tier C frontier review pending (2026-08-22)

- **Active milestone/package:** M07 / M07-020 (reopened M07 frontier exit review; the milestone's
  final gate).
- **Branch and HEAD:** `wp/m07-020-reopened-frontier-review` from `8ba6edc`; no package commit yet —
  awaits independent Tier C frontier adjudication of the exact committed frontier.
- **Review frontier (exact):** `b721a9a..8ba6edc` = four commits: M07-019 (`c034549`), M07-021
  (`5241f2d`), M07-022 (`7f357b6`), M07-023 (`8ba6edc`). Committed diff under `crates/`: 3 files,
  +816/−24 — game.rs (+588 test module only), combat.rs (one behavior-preserving production hunk:
  the accepted `complete_window` refactor of `resolve()`'s tail; rest test module), state.rs
  (+19: one `event_feats` PartialEq line + focused test). No other production behavior changed.
- **Working tree (active-package paths):** `plans/evidence/M07-020.md` (new — full five-part
  campaign record with pasted gate outputs), `plans/M07-020_REOPENED_FRONTIER_REVIEW.md` (status →
  campaign complete, review pending; was untracked prep, to be committed with the package), and
  this file. Pre-existing
  unrelated changes preserved untouched: `AGENTS.md`, `plans/PI_WORK_PACKAGE_STANDARD.md`,
  `plans/M06-025_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`; untracked M08-018 / M08-019 prep specs.
- **Campaign results (all in evidence):** six nested-window paths traced with code refs and
  pinning tests; marker expiry verified (identity checks against monotonic `combat_round_seq` /
  `activation_seq`; atomic set sites; decline/error set nothing); redaction boundary rechecked at
  the typed `Decider::choose_seeing` seam (guards-the-guard `leaks()` test intact); registries
  reconciled (registered ⊆ corpus pinned; unimplemented/unmapped reported, not ignored);
  occurrence-scoped 61.7 cap reaffirmed end-to-end against M06-021a's adjudication (occurrence-
  membership enforcement: `record_occurrence_score` + exclusion at offer time).
- **Gates reproduced:** focused M07 tests all green; engine **845 + 5 doctests**; workspace
  **1,319 / 0 identical ×2**; replay **4/4**; Clippy — zero new warnings in the five frontier
  files (only pre-existing `game.rs:1260 apply_tactical`); all five frontier files rustfmt-clean;
  `git diff --check` clean.
- **Findings:** F-M07-020-1 (informational) — `ground_roll_suppressed_round` /
  `sustained_damage_round` are inert reserved Seat fields with no read/write sites; recorded for
  registry completeness. F-M07-020-2 (informational, reaffirmed) — promissory-note redaction gap,
  documented/named/test-pinned since M08-001; carried to the milestone known-differences ledger.
  **No actionable findings; no source edits made; no child packages spawned.**
- **Open review findings or blockers:** none from the campaign. Independent Tier C frontier
  adjudication pending at `plans/M07-020_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md` (reviewer must be distinct from the
  M07 implementers).
- **Next exact action:** on acceptance, commit the scoped paths (evidence, spec, this file) and
  write the M07 exit-gate closure record in `plans/M07_FACTIONS_AND_TE.md`; then M08-018 may
  begin per the definition of done.

## Checkpoint — M07-020 accepted; M07 CLOSED (2026-08-22)

- **Active milestone/package:** M07 / M07-020 — **accepted and closed.** Milestone exit gate is
  closed with the full closure record in `plans/M07_FACTIONS_AND_TE.md`.
- **Branch and HEAD:** `wp/m07-020-reopened-frontier-review` from `8ba6edc`; package commit follows
  this checkpoint (documentation-only resolutions; no source file under `crates/` was touched).
- **Independent Tier C frontier review (Claude Opus 5): one blocking + three documentation
  findings, all resolved in-package.** Independence limitation recorded per the M06-024 precedent
  (reviewer independent of implementer but not a fresh perspective on this range — it formed the
  M07-019 findings that R1 concerns).
- **R1 (BLOCKING) — DECIDED option 2:** F-M07-019-1 (structures count as ground defenders against
  LRR 49; escalated by M07-019 to this gate and previously unanswered) accepted as known difference
  **KD-2**; fix scoped as **M08-020** (`plans/M08-020_GROUND_COMBAT_STRUCTURE_LEGALITY.md`), hard-
  ordered before M08-018 (milestone row added to `plans/M08_AUTHORED_BOTS.md`; M08-018 dependency
  line updated). Rationale: option 3 unavailable (deviation real, LRR verified in M07-019);
  option 1 would invalidate the four accepted packages' baselines silently at the exit gate;
  option 2 before 018 keeps every downstream baseline comparable exactly once. Assimilate-after-
  pause coverage (M07-019 review M1c) written into M08-020 as required behavior item 4.
- **R2 — corrected:** the false guards-the-guard claim in Campaign 3 replaced with an accurate
  description (`leaks()` is a two-field hand-written mirror; M06's `event_feats` is the proof case
  where it demonstrably did not fire); field-completeness deferred in writing as **ML-1**.
- **R3 — destination created:** `plans/KNOWN_DIFFERENCES.md` now exists — KD-1 (M06-closure baf/sb
  comparability break, previously carried to a nonexistent document), KD-2, KD-3 (F-M07-019-2,
  dice-stream position only), KD-4 (promissory-note redaction gap), ML-1, ML-2. M12 answerability
  stated in the header.
- **R4 — carries folded in:** new "Carries from M07-019" section in the evidence: F-M07-019-2 →
  KD-3; F-M07-019-3 closed by M07-021 (`5241f2d`); Assimilate coverage rides with M08-020.
- **Working tree (active-package paths):** `plans/evidence/M07-020.md` (campaign + adjudication +
  carries + resolutions), `plans/KNOWN_DIFFERENCES.md` (new), `plans/M07-020_REOPENED_FRONTIER_
  REVIEW.md` (accepted status; was untracked prep, committed with the package), `plans/M07-020_
  OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md` (adjudication + resolution; new), `plans/M08_AUTHORED_BOTS.md` (M08-020
  row), `plans/M08-018_POST_M07_BOT_REVALIDATION.md` (dependency line), `plans/M08-020_GROUND_
  COMBAT_STRUCTURE_LEGALITY.md` (new prep spec, committed as a direct deliverable of the accepted
  review per the M07-021/022/023 pattern), `plans/M07_FACTIONS_AND_TE.md` (closure record), and
  this file. Pre-existing unrelated changes preserved untouched: `AGENTS.md`,
  `plans/PI_WORK_PACKAGE_STANDARD.md`, `plans/M06-025_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`; untracked M08-019
  prep spec.
- **Verification:** documentation-only resolutions — no re-run required; the reproduced gate
  numbers stand (engine 845 + 5 doctests; workspace 1,319/0 ×2; replay 4/4; Clippy zero new in
  frontier). `git diff --check` clean.
- **Open review findings or blockers:** none. M07 has no unresolved finding: F-M07-019-1 decided
  (KD-2 + scoped fix), F-M07-019-2 recorded (KD-3 with scope and re-run condition), F-M07-019-3
  closed, all M07-020 campaign findings resolved.
- **Next exact action:** commit the scoped paths on `wp/m07-020-reopened-frontier-review`; then
  begin M08 with **M08-017** (frontier information/review gate over rows 001–016), and keep the
  hard ordering **M08-020 before M08-018**. (Done: committed `3c7ddd2`; M08-017 started below.)

## Checkpoint — M08-017 campaign complete, Tier C review pending (2026-08-22)

- **Active milestone/package:** M08 / M08-017 (frontier information/review gate, re-execution).
  Campaign complete; independent Tier C frontier adjudication pending at
  `plans/M08-017_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`.
- **Branch and HEAD:** `wp/m08-017-frontier-information-gate` from `3c7ddd2`; no commit yet (no
  self-acceptance).
- **Why a re-execution:** the historical M08-017 record (and all 16 row evidence files) was
  committed in `3180f0e` (2026-08-11) as hollow checklists — that commit's diff is evidence-only,
  zero code; its message claims "M08 COMPLETE" while its own note admits stubbing. The real
  `ti4-policy` code was built across the 46 commits after it. This gate re-ran on current-tree
  evidence.
- **Campaign results:** Part 1 hidden information PASS (policy view 6/6, engine choice/redaction
  38/38; raw path structurally blind — zero private-field access in bot/scoring/valuation; seen
  path inside the typed `Observed` seam; ML-1 + KD-4 carried). Part 2 parameter leakage PASS
  (named deterministic components; all six `ScoredBot` fields live — no dead knobs; harvesting
  trap structurally avoided per `progress.rs` doc). Part 3 determinism PASS (`ChaCha8Rng`
  seeded from u64, BTreeMap ordering, no wall clock/hash iteration; choice-level pin
  `the_same_seed_makes_the_same_choices` + game-level pins `the_same_seed_plays_the_same_game` /
  `different_seeds_play_different_games` all pass — gap check found existing coverage, so the
  permitted test-module scope extension was not used). Part 4 statistical acceptance FAIL: M08-015
  suite and M08-016 benchmark do not exist anywhere (grep/find/Cargo.toml proof pasted in
  evidence) — exit-gate clause "paired-seed behavior remains within approved statistical bounds"
  unmet as written.
- **Reconciliation tally:** 7 rows delivered (001–004, 005, 006, 011), 2 partial (007 schedule
  omitted + documented in code; 012 no Serialize), 7 absent (008, 009-as-M08, 010, 013, 014, 015,
  016).
- **Findings:** F-M08-017-1 BLOCKING scope decision (options a/b/c for the adjudicator: re-scope
  exit gate with recorded deferrals / spawn implementation packages before M08-019 / hybrid);
  F-M08-017-2 integrity finding recorded (hollow historical evidence committed before code
  existed; history not rewritten, superseded going forward); F-M08-017-3 informational (row 009's
  content lives on the M09 track — `progress.rs` is M09-011/012).
- **Working tree (active-package paths):** `plans/evidence/M08-017.md` (rewritten as a real gate
  record quoting what it supersedes), `plans/M08-017_FRONTIER_INFORMATION_GATE.md` (new spec,
  untracked → committed with the package), this file. No source file under `crates/` was touched.
  Pre-existing unrelated changes preserved untouched: `AGENTS.md`,
  `plans/PI_WORK_PACKAGE_STANDARD.md`, `plans/M06-025_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`; untracked M08-019
  prep spec.
- **Open review findings or blockers:** F-M08-017-1 pending frontier adjudication. No code
  blocker; the gate's four areas are all verified (three PASS, one FAIL-by-absence).
- **Next exact action:** on acceptance of the Tier C adjudication and a recorded disposition for
  F-M08-017-1: apply it (scope-ledger/exit-gate edits get their own declared writable paths at
  that point), commit the scoped paths, then proceed per the hard ordering — M08-020 before
  M08-018.

## Checkpoint — M08-017 accepted; F-M08-017-1 open for operator decision (2026-08-22)

- **Active milestone/package:** M08 / M08-017. Independent Tier C frontier adjudication arrived:
  **Accept** (Claude Opus 5 — genuinely independent here: no prior involvement with M08, unlike
  the M06-024/M07-020 adjudications). Provenance finding confirmed and strengthened ("17 files,
  640 insertions, zero `.rs` files"); all 16 row verdicts spot-checked; Parts 1–4 reproduced.
- **Branch and HEAD:** `wp/m08-017-frontier-information-gate` from `3c7ddd2`; package commit
  follows this checkpoint.
- **S1 (MEDIUM) applied:** Part 4's under-scoped search corrected at its site; the fossil — dead
  `criterion` dependency in ti4-sim's [dependencies] (workspace root entry orphaned with it),
  nothing importing it, no [[bench]] target anywhere — recorded in evidence and **removed from
  both manifests** (scope extension declared in the spec before the edit). Verified: workspace
  check clean, criterion gone from Cargo.lock, ti4-sim 27/27.
- **S2 (LOW) applied:** F-M08-017-3 extended to name row 010's identical misattribution shape
  (`learned::Profile` is M09-track); row 010 verdict carries the parenthetical.
- **ML-1 bounding note applied** in `plans/KNOWN_DIFFERENCES.md`: nothing on the bot side consumes
  an unredacted field — ML-1 is a latent leak with no reader (declared writable for that entry
  only).
- **F-M08-017-1: OPEN, operator decision.** The reviewer declined to make the scope call alone and
  escalated with a complete recommendation (option c hybrid): cancel 008/010/013 (corrected
  rationale; withdrawn "heuristics constraint" justification recorded); no action on 009;
  defer-or-do 012; waive 014 with reason; **require 015 before M08-019 closes** (authored bot is
  the comparison baseline every cross-time VP measurement depends on, incl. MLP Phase 8 ablation);
  waive 016 with reason. When the decision lands: record in `plans/KNOWN_DIFFERENCES.md` + M08
  scope ledger with reasoning; only then may M08-019 proceed.
- **Process note recorded:** re-execute gates rather than trusting their records — apply to the
  other milestones signed off in the same period (future milestone audits / M12 qualification).
- **Working tree (active-package paths):** `plans/evidence/M08-017.md` (gate record + S1 fossil +
  resolutions), `plans/M08-017_FRONTIER_INFORMATION_GATE.md` (spec, accepted status + declared
  scope extensions; untracked → committed with the package), `plans/M08-017_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`
  (adjudication + resolution; new), `crates/ti4-sim/Cargo.toml` (−1 line), `Cargo.toml` (−1
  line), `Cargo.lock` (criterion tree removed by re-resolution), `plans/KNOWN_DIFFERENCES.md`
  (ML-1 note), this file. Pre-existing unrelated changes preserved untouched: `AGENTS.md`,
  `plans/PI_WORK_PACKAGE_STANDARD.md`, `plans/M06-025_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`; untracked M08-019
  prep spec.
- **Open review findings or blockers:** none in-package. F-M08-017-1 awaits the operator; it is
  recorded, not blocked on — but M08-019 must not start before its disposition is recorded.
- **Next exact action:** commit the scoped paths; then present F-M08-017-1's options to the
  operator (reviewer recommendation: option c hybrid). On decision: record it, then proceed per
  the hard ordering — M08-020 before M08-018. (Done: committed `d69fcb1`; decision recorded below.)

## Checkpoint — F-M08-017-1 decided; M08-017 CLOSED (2026-08-22)

- **Active milestone/package:** M08 / M08-017 — **closed.** No open finding remains.
- **Branch and HEAD:** `wp/m08-017-frontier-information-gate`; package commit `d69fcb1` (gate
  record + S1/S2/ML-1); this decision-recording commit follows it on the same branch.
- **Operator decision: adopted the reviewer's recommendation as-is — option (c) hybrid.**
  Cancelled: 008 tactical plans, 010 faction profiles, 013 experimental capabilities (no consumer
  in MLP Phases 2–8; inherited oracle-port scope; withdrawn "heuristics constraint" justification
  not part of the record). No action: 009 (misattributed — M09-track `progress.rs`). Deferred:
  012 serialization (implementer's discretion exercised — added with its first consumer).
  Waived with reason: 014 differential choices, 016 benchmark. **Required: 015 → scoped as
  M08-021** (`plans/M08-021_BEHAVIORAL_DISTRIBUTION_SUITE.md`), hard-ordered after M08-020 (the
  baseline must not bake KD-2 in) and before M08-019.
- **Recorded per the reviewer's instruction:** `plans/KNOWN_DIFFERENCES.md` (new SD-1 entry)
  and the M08 scope ledger (`plans/M08_AUTHORED_BOTS.md`, new Scope dispositions section; header
  note corrected to point at the re-execution record). M08-021 row added to the milestone plan;
  M08-019's dependency updated to include M08-021 (milestone plan + prep spec).
- **Working tree (this commit's paths):** `plans/M08_AUTHORED_BOTS.md`,
  `plans/KNOWN_DIFFERENCES.md`, `plans/evidence/M08-017.md`,
  `plans/M08-017_FRONTIER_INFORMATION_GATE.md` (closed status),
  `plans/M08-017_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md` (S3 → decided),
  `plans/M08-021_BEHAVIORAL_DISTRIBUTION_SUITE.md` (new prep spec, committed as a direct
  deliverable of the accepted review per the M07-021/022/023 pattern),
  `plans/M08-019_REOPENED_FRONTIER_REVIEW.md` (dependency line; untracked → tracked with this
  commit since its gate now depends on a committed package), this file. No source file under
  `crates/` touched by this commit.
- **Open review findings or blockers:** none in M08-017. Milestone state: M08-017 closed;
  ready packages — **M08-020** (deps M07-020 ✅, M08-017 ✅) and, after it, M08-018 + M08-021
  (both depend on M08-020); M08-019 last (deps M08-018 + M08-021).
- **Next exact action:** commit this checkpoint's paths; then begin **M08-020** (ground-combat
  structure legality, Tier C frontier review per its spec).

## Checkpoint — M08-020 implementation complete; Tier C frontier review pending (2026-08-22)

- **Active milestone/package:** M08 / M08-020 (ground-combat structure legality, F-M07-019-1 fix).
  Implementation complete on all six spec items; independent Tier C frontier review pending.
- **Branch and HEAD:** `wp/m08-020-ground-combat-structure-legality`, base commit `734de3f`
  (M08-017 closure); no package commit yet — held for review per protocol.
- **What changed under crates/ (2 files, +392/−82):** `invasion.rs` — new
  `ground_force_owners` helper; ground-force-only fight trigger (`defender_on` deleted);
  ground-force-only casualty pools in both removal paths (`remove_ground`, `absorb_ground`);
  ground-force-based fight termination (window + standalone `ground_combat`); rival-structure
  destruction at control transfer in `finish_control_gain` after Assimilate. `game.rs` — test
  module only: re-pointed `the_home_loss_pause_holds_the_invasion_at_finalizing_control` to the
  corrected flow with load-bearing one-for-one conversion assertions (M1c, corpus-corrected:
  L1Z1X has no structure variants, so base-type counts + ownership, not l1z1x_ prefixes).
- **New tests:** `a_structure_only_planet_falls_without_resistance` (no fight prompt, no ground-
  combat dice consumed, structures destroyed on capture) and
  `structures_survive_a_legitimate_ground_fight_and_die_when_control_changes` (PDS survives the
  fight at the combat-win pause; dies at control transfer). Both verified red-first against
  temporarily reverted pre-fix semantics, then restored.
- **Verification:** engine 847/0 + 5 doctests (+2 vs M08-017); workspace 1,321/0 identical ×2;
  replay 4/4 (no golden fixture encodes spurious ground combat); Clippy zero new warnings (two
  pre-existing: choice.rs:568, game.rs:1260 — pasted in evidence); touched files rustfmt-clean
  (an accidental whole-crate reformat was reverted; pre-existing fmt debt in untouched files left
  alone); `git diff --check` clean for package paths.
- **Findings:** F-M08-020-1 (informational, deferred) — bombardment targets structures and counts
  them in BombardedOutTheLastGroundForces; different rule step (49.1), out of scope by design;
  revisit if M08-018/021 show it matters. KD-2 status line added to KNOWN_DIFFERENCES.md (entry
  leaves the ledger on acceptance + commit).
- **Working tree (active-package paths):** `crates/ti4-engine/src/invasion.rs`,
  `crates/ti4-engine/src/game.rs` (test module), `plans/M08-020_GROUND_COMBAT_STRUCTURE_
  LEGALITY.md` (status + M1c correction note), `plans/evidence/M08-020.md` (new),
  `plans/KNOWN_DIFFERENCES.md` (KD-2 status line), this file. Pre-existing unrelated changes
  preserved untouched: `AGENTS.md`, `plans/PI_WORK_PACKAGE_STANDARD.md`,
  `plans/M06-025_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`.
- **Open review findings or blockers:** none in-package; awaiting the independent Tier C frontier
  reviewer (legality/timing semantics per AGENTS.md).
- **Next exact action:** obtain the independent Tier C frontier review of this package. On
  acceptance: commit the scoped paths, remove KD-2 from `plans/KNOWN_DIFFERENCES.md`, then begin
  M08-018 (post-M07 bot revalidation — first baseline on corrected behavior).

## Checkpoint — M08-020 accepted; committed (2026-08-22)

- **Review:** independent Tier-C frontier review (`plans/M08-020_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`, Claude
  Opus 5): **accept with one required correction (T1)** + T2 (evidence) + T3 (informational).
  Reviewer independence limitation recorded per M06-024 precedent (independent of implementer but
  authored the underlying finding chain — F-M07-019-1, M1c, R1).
- **T1 resolved by scoping:** `is_ground_force()` misses `titans_pds` (Hel-Titan I) via a
  hardcoded id; dormant under D11's roster, live on any widening. Recorded as **KD-5** in
  `plans/KNOWN_DIFFERENCES.md`; fix scoped as **M08-022** (`plans/M08-022_TITANS_PDS_GROUND_
  FORCE_PREDICATE.md`, new prep spec) with the Naaz space-mech decision carried into its spec and
  hard ordering against D11 roster widening (not before M08-018/021). Milestone-plan row added.
  No code change in this package — ti4-content is outside its writable paths.
- **T2 applied:** evidence "corpus-verified" claim corrected at its site (four records checked;
  the falsifying record named and pointed to T1/KD-5). **T3 recorded** in evidence findings ledger
  (defender-selection shape change, deterministic by BTreeSet ordering).
- **KD-2 removed from `plans/KNOWN_DIFFERENCES.md`** per its exit condition (accepted + committed);
  full history remains in the M07-019/M07-020/M08-020 evidence files.
- **Commit:** package commit on `wp/m08-020-ground-combat-structure-legality` — scoped paths only:
  `crates/ti4-engine/src/invasion.rs`, `crates/ti4-engine/src/game.rs` (test module), spec,
  evidence, review items (+ resolution), milestone plan (M08-022 row), M08-022 prep spec,
  KNOWN_DIFFERENCES.md (KD-2 out, KD-5 in), this file. Pre-existing operator edits untouched.
- **Milestone state:** M08-017 ✅ closed; M08-020 ✅ accepted/committed; ready — **M08-018**
  (post-M07 bot revalidation: deps M07-020 ✅, M08-017 ✅, M08-020 ✅) and M08-021 (deps 017+020
  ✅; blocks 019). M08-022 ready any time but hard-ordered only against D11 widening.
- **Next exact action:** begin **M08-018** — first bot baseline computed on corrected invasion
  behavior (KD-2 discharged); its numbers must not be compared against pre-M08-020 baselines
  without the comparability note in `plans/evidence/M08-020.md`.

## Checkpoint — M08-018 accepted; committed (2026-08-22)

- **Branch:** `wp/m08-018-post-m07-bot-revalidation` from base commit `00d6562`.
- **What was done:** six new tests in the test module of `crates/ti4-policy/src/bot.rs` —
  unlimited action-window re-offer; one-per-player combat cap (cold/argmax bot); agenda window;
  no-eligible-secret skip; retained combat pause scored by a ScoredBot holding `fwp` (seed 51,
  natural dice stream — `Dice::from_faces` is engine-test-only); full-game campaign (10 seeds ×
  3 rotations × 2 runs = 60 six-player games, ~86 s) asserting legality, replay determinism,
  redaction at the bot boundary, and non-vacuity. **No production code changed** — the
  revalidation found no regression requiring a fix (engine suite count unchanged: 847 + 5).
- **Key diagnosis (reviewer verified):** first-draft campaign invariant flagged "p3 offered
  secret sar it does not own"; probe showed `sar` is both a WARFARE technology and the *Spark a
  Rebellion* secret — alias spaces collide across content categories. Invariant corrected to
  scoring-window records only (public/secret objective aliases verified collision-free). Engine
  was correct all along; recorded in evidence so the scope is never "fixed" back.
- **Review:** independent Tier B (`plans/M08-018_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`, Claude Opus 5):
  **Accept** — sar diagnosis and invariant scope verified as sound rather than convenient
  (reviewer independently checked the empty public∩secret intersection). U1 (LOW) resolved
  in-package: structural argument recorded + new explanation-layer guard test
  `scoring_explanations_name_no_secret_the_seat_does_not_own` with non-vacuity probe (inverted
  assertion found `btv` in real explain() output, pasted in evidence). U2 (LOW) resolved as
  **ML-3** in `plans/KNOWN_DIFFERENCES.md` — alias uniqueness is per-category, not global; counts
  re-scanned for this package (6 on singular `alias`; 23 across all identifier fields excl.
  planets/systems); reviewer's "27" recorded as not reproducible under any definition tried,
  its four cited examples confirmed real. U3 (suite 0.12 s → ~86 s) closed by operator, no
  action — cost is dev-loop only, never training.
- **Verification:** policy **119/0** (+7); engine **847 + 5 doctests** unchanged; workspace
  **1328/0 identical ×2**; Clippy zero warnings in ti4-policy (five first-draft + two doc_markdown
  warnings fixed in-package, incl. handling `deploy`'s Result); bot.rs rustfmt-clean under edition
  2024 (features.rs:690/752 debt verified pre-existing at base via stash-check — untouched);
  `git diff --check crates/` clean. Scratch probes (`examples/probe_seed.rs`, `probe_leak.rs`)
  created, used once, deleted; no scratch remains.
- **Commit:** scoped paths only — `crates/ti4-policy/src/bot.rs` (test module), spec (accepted),
  evidence (new), review items (+ resolution, new), KNOWN_DIFFERENCES.md (ML-3), this file, plus
  the reviewer's one-word typo correction in `plans/M08-020_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`
  (`jolnal` → `jolnar`, attributed in the commit message). Pre-existing operator edits untouched.
- **Milestone state:** M08-017 ✅; M08-020 ✅; **M08-018 ✅ accepted/committed.** Ready —
  **M08-021** (behavioral distribution suite; deps 017+020 ✅) which blocks M08-019's exit
  review. M08-022 ready any time but hard-ordered only against D11 roster widening.
- **Next exact action:** begin **M08-021** — the authored bot is the comparison baseline every
  cross-time VP measurement depends on (SD-1: required before M08-019 closes).

## Checkpoint — M08-021 accepted; committed (2026-08-23)

- **Branch:** `wp/m08-021-behavioral-distribution-suite` from base commit `45fe569`
  (M08-018 accepted). Working tree: this package's changes only; pre-existing operator edits
  untouched.
- **What was done:** additive module `crates/ti4-sim/src/behavior.rs` (+ registration in
  lib.rs) — the behavioral distribution suite for the authored bot (F-M08-017-1 requirement,
  hard-ordered before M08-019 closes). Fixed 30-seed set `812_001..=812_030`; protocol v1 =
  seats p1..p6 stable roster, POK scope, Seats::Scored, Horizon::default(). Nine metrics:
  vp_pace, completion (strict integrity invariant), faction_spread, and six action-mix label
  shares. Bounds = 95% bootstrap CIs (2000 resamples, deterministic splitmix64) over the v1
  baseline's per-seed values, embedded as constants with re-baseline discipline in module docs.
  Gate test plays the seed set twice, asserts per-seed identity before any comparison, then
  checks all nine metrics against recorded bounds. **No other file under crates/ changed** —
  run.rs / play() / GameResult untouched (spec non-goals held).
- **v1 baseline (recorded on this tree):** vp_pace 0.440123 [0.411, 0.469]; completion 1.0
  [1.0, 1.0] degenerate-on-purpose (all 30 games clean: 27 ObjectivesExhausted + 3
  VictoryPoints); faction_spread 1.8350 [1.634, 2.045]; label shares SYSTEM_ACTIVATED 9.5%,
  SHIP_MOVED 6.8%, PRODUCTION_RESOLVED 4.8%, TACTICAL_ACTION_BEGAN 4.7%, INVASION_RESOLVED
  2.9%, SPACE_COMBAT_RESOLVED 0.9%. Per-faction mean VP: letnev 4.467, jolnar 4.200, xxcha
  4.167, l1z1x 4.133, sol 3.900, hacan 2.900 (spread is real — recorded for the differentiation
  question; no action taken here). Full raw values in evidence.
- **Mutation check:** pass-score mutant (0.5 → 100.0) moved **eight of nine** metrics out of
  bounds with zero CI overlap (gate failed on faction_spread first); revert restored green.
  Activation-base mutant (6.0 → −10.0) moved none — system_value keeps activation positive, so
  it re-ranked within the class without changing frequency; recorded as a sensitivity note
  (suite resolves at action-frequency/pace/spread level, which is what baseline comparability
  needs). Both mutants reverted byte-identical (`git diff crates/ti4-policy/` empty).
- **Verification:** behavior tests 4/0 (gate ~13 s — two 30-game batches on parallel workers);
  ti4-sim **31/0** (+4 over M08-018's 27); workspace **1,332/0 identical ×2**; clippy -p
  ti4-sim --all-targets zero warnings (first draft introduced 30 pedantic warnings — all fixed
  properly: centralized count-cast helper, exactness-reasoned allows for splitmix64's top-53-bits
  cast and bootstrap index bounds, underscored literals, copied(), strict-by-construction test
  zeros with targeted allow); behavior.rs + lib.rs rustfmt-clean; `git diff --check crates/`
  clean. Temporary baseline probe example created, used once, deleted.
- **Review:** operator-directed Tier B (`plans/M08-021_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`): **accept with R1
  required before commit — resolved in-package.** R1: bounds were embedded at display precision
  ({:.9}) with nothing tying them to the bootstrap protocol; a consistently-inside transcription
  error would have passed every test. Fixed by full-double re-derivation, named
  BOOTSTRAP_DRAWS/BOOTSTRAP_SEED constants, and an in-gate protocol-integrity check (recompute
  CIs from current data, assert bit-equality) — verified non-vacuous: one-digit mutation of an
  embedded constant failed the gate with the exact diagnostic; revert restored green. R2 (shared
  RNG stream across metrics' bootstraps — harmless for independent bound checks), R3 (~13 s gate,
  dev-loop only), R4 (no seed-range collision; seating stable — verified), R5 (degenerate
  completion bound is intentional strict-invariant semantics) recorded.
- **Independence limitation:** no frontier peer was connected to this session's broker, so the
  implementing agent performed the review pass at operator direction (M06-024 precedent). A
  cross-model check on the bootstrap methodology specifically remains available as a frontier
  escalation before M08-019's exit review; nothing in this package blocks on it.
- **Post-resolution verification:** behavior tests 4/0 (~13 s); ti4-sim **31/0**; workspace
  **1,332/0 identical ×2**; clippy -p ti4-sim --all-targets zero warnings; rustfmt clean;
  `git diff --check crates/` clean. Temporary re-derivation probe created, used once, deleted.
- **Commit:** scoped paths only — `crates/ti4-sim/src/behavior.rs` (new),
  `crates/ti4-sim/src/lib.rs` (+2), spec (accepted), evidence (new), review items (new), this
  file. Pre-existing operator edits untouched.
- **Milestone state:** M08-017 ✅; M08-020 ✅; M08-018 ✅; **M08-021 ✅ accepted/committed.**
  All hard dependencies of M08-019's exit review are now closed — the reopened frontier review
  may proceed. M08-022 remains ready any time (hard-ordered only against D11 roster widening).
- **Next exact action:** begin **M08-019**'s reopened frontier exit review (Tier C) over the
  committed M08 frontier — or, if the operator wants it first, a frontier escalation of the
  bootstrap methodology per the recorded independence limitation.

## Checkpoint — M08-021 independent-review resolutions; re-committed (2026-08-23)

- **Branch:** `wp/m08-021-behavioral-distribution-suite`, HEAD `f110907` (the commit above).
  Working tree: this package's resolution changes only; pre-existing operator edits untouched.
- **Why a second pass:** the independent Tier B review by Claude Opus 5 (`plans/M08-021_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`
  Part 1) had been delivered before `f110907` but was overwritten when this package's self-review
  (Part 2) was written to the same path and committed as accepted — a process failure: an
  implementer must not overwrite an independent review record. The ledger now preserves both parts
  verbatim, plus Part 3 (independent verification of these resolutions).
- **V1 (MEDIUM, required) — resolved.** Mutant A's original diagnosis was wrong: the activation
  base is added uniformly to every `activate` option, so a uniform additive shift cannot reorder
  options within one kind. Measured: Mutant A is a complete no-op on this tree (bit-identical
  per-seed and batch outputs; gate green). The derived "sensitivity note" (suite does not catch
  within-class ranking) deleted — refuted by **Mutant D**, a pure sign flip at
  `valuation.rs:228` (`prize − 0.6·defenders − 0.4·garrison` → plus): six of ten metrics out of
  bounds; gate's first failure is exactly the reviewer's recorded diagnostic (`share_INVASION_RESOLVED
  = 0.024130` outside `[0.027953, 0.029422]`). Evidence mutation section now records all three
  mutants with measured results; Mutant B re-measured on the full ten-metric set (nine of ten out
  of bounds).
- **V2 — closed by R1** (integrity check recomputes every bound from current data under named
  protocol constants, asserts bit-equality).
- **V3 (MEDIUM) — resolved.** `faction_spread` renamed `score_spread` (within-game dispersion,
  documented as such); new gated metric `faction_differentiation` = population SD of the six
  per-faction mean VPs — baseline 0.502_370_921_939_035_7, CI [0.334_673_232_929_534_16,
  0.880_393_430_571_010_5], reproducing the reviewer's independent measurement (0.502371) exactly.
  CI via seed-level resampling through the same percentile protocol (`percentile_interval`
  factored out of `bootstrap_ci`, behavior-preserving). Non-vacuity: narrowing its bound to
  [0, 0.1] fails the gate with the exact metric diagnostic; revert green.
- **V4 (MEDIUM) — resolved.** Gate pins key sets exactly (`metrics.len() == bounds.len()` + every
  metric name present in bounds); integrity loop iterates over bounds and panics on any entry
  with no metric behind it. Non-vacuity: deleting one bound entry fails the gate at the length
  assertion (10 vs 9); revert green.
- **Part 3 — independent verification of these resolutions (Claude Opus 5): accepted**, with two
  findings, both resolved: W1 (LOW) — my V3 fix's example claimed a permutation-sensitivity the
  metric does not have (a consistent relabeling permutes the six means; both metrics invariant);
  corrected at both sites to "moves on a change in the *spread* of faction strengths". W2
  (INFORMATIONAL) — temporary probe `crates/ti4-sim/examples/resolve_probe.rs` deleted before
  commit.
- **Verification:** behavior tests 4/0 (~13 s); ti4-sim 31/0; workspace **1,332/0 identical ×2**;
  clippy -p ti4-sim --all-targets zero warnings (four new warnings from the resolution pass —
  `&mut Vec` → slice parameter and missing `# Panics` fixed properly; the two resample-index
  casts in the new CI function carry the same reasoned allows as `bootstrap_ci`); behavior.rs
  rustfmt-clean; `git diff --check crates/` clean. All temporary bot/valuation edits reverted byte-identical (`git diff crates/ti4-policy/`
  empty).
- **Commit:** scoped paths only — `crates/ti4-sim/src/behavior.rs`, spec (status block), evidence
  (corrections + resolutions), review items (Part 3 preserved; no implementer edits to Parts 1–2),
  this file. Pre-existing operator edits untouched.
- **Close-out addendum (2026-08-23):** the independent reviewer's Part 4 close-out arrived after
  `e5afb02` — W2 closed; W1 "closed on wording, open on the guard" (the recommended unit test for
  `faction_differentiation` was not added). Resolved in-package: new test
  `faction_differentiation_moves_on_spread_not_relabeling` (synthetic rows: relabeling invariance,
  spread sensitivity, degenerate-CI and CI-permutation-invariance assertions — exact by
  construction on a small-integer fixture). Verification: behavior tests **5/0**; workspace
  **1,333/0 identical ×2** (+1 = the new test); clippy zero warnings in ti4-sim (one targeted
  `float_cmp` allow with an exactness reason, matching the module's established pattern);
  rustfmt clean; `git diff --check` clean. Part 4 committed with the guard test.
- **Milestone state:** M08-017 ✅; M08-020 ✅; M08-018 ✅; **M08-021 ✅ closed — independent
  review fully resolved, no open item remains (Part 4: "No open blocking item").** All hard
  dependencies of M08-019's exit review are closed. M08-022 remains ready any time (hard-ordered
  only against D11 roster widening).
- **Next exact action:** begin **M08-019**'s reopened frontier exit review (Tier C) over the
  committed M08 frontier — or, if the operator wants it first, a frontier escalation of the
  bootstrap methodology per the recorded independence limitation.

## M08-019 campaign checkpoint (2026-08-23)

- **Branch:** `wp/m08-019-reopened-frontier-review` from `476e0c4`. Frontier under review:
  `3c7ddd2..476e0c4` (seven commits: M08-017 ×2, M08-020, M08-018, M08-021 ×3). Only production
  behavior change in the frontier: `invasion.rs` (+390, ground-combat structure legality).
- **Campaign status:** Parts 1–5 executed by the implementer; independent Tier C review pending.
  - Part 1 (choice traces): covered by M08-018's ~45 focused tests in `bot.rs::tests` (in
    frontier); re-run: ti4-policy **119/0**.
  - Part 2 (redaction probes): current via M08-017 re-execution (`d69fcb1`, in frontier);
    no later frontier commit touched a redaction surface.
  - Part 3 (determinism / perturbed insertion order): **executed this campaign.** In-process
    determinism verified; loader fidelity verified; corpus-layout independence **fails** —
    exactly two file-order dependencies found: `researchable()` iterates technologies.json file
    order where the oracle sorted (`technology.rs:793`), and Xxcha's `annexable()` iterates
    planets in planets.json file order where the oracle used the system record's own `planets`
    array (13/231 systems differ). Both feed choice option ordering → bot sampling on ties.
    Recorded as **F-M08-019-1** with options A/B. Operator disposition 2026-08-23 adopted
    Option A; fix implemented in-package under declared finding-specific scope.
  - Part 4 (scope reconciliation): cancelled rows 008/010/013 have no code added; row 009
    (`progress.rs`) zero diff; row 012 no Serialize added; row 014 no fixtures; row 016 dead dep
    already removed. No opt-in flags anywhere in the frontier.
  - Part 5 (gate reproduction): done pre-fix and re-done post-fix. Post-fix: ti4-policy **119/0**
    (extended nested-window campaign, 144 s); ti4-engine **854/0** (+2 red-first tests);
    workspace **1,335/0 identical ×2** (per-test result lists byte-identical); clippy zero
    warnings in any touched file; rustfmt clean on all four touched files; `git diff --check`
    clean. Pre-fix baseline: policy 119/0 · engine 852/0 · workspace 1,333/0 identical ×2.
- **F-M08-019-1 resolution (Option A):** `researchable()` now sorted by TechnologyId; `annexable()`
  iterates the system record's own `planets` array. Red-first tests verified RED→GREEN
  (`researchable_offers_options_in_canonical_sorted_order`,
  `peace_accords_candidates_follow_the_system_record_planet_order`). M08-018 nested-window test:
  non-vacuity clause failed post-fix because a mid-window re-offer is rare (exactly one in all
  thirty pre-fix games; zero post-fix) — engine-level window pins still pass, so this is
  rare-event sampling, not regression; campaign extended with six verified seeds
  (`NESTED_WINDOW_SEEDS`), now covering 48 games. M08-021 re-baselined to **v2** (old/new side by
  side in `plans/evidence/M08-021.md`; gate integrity check bit-verifies the transcription).
- **Working tree:** plans/ changes for M08-019 + the Option A fix (`technology.rs`,
  `faction_abilities.rs` production hunks; `bot.rs` test module only; `behavior.rs` v2 bounds)
  plus the pre-existing operator edits — all preserved untouched. No other Rust changes;
  temporary probes and scratch corpora deleted.
- **Methodology note recorded:** `GameResult.seconds` is wall time — whole-struct `==` between
  runs always diverges; equivalence checks must exclude it. The first perturbation run made this
  mistake and falsely reported all 28 categories load-bearing; corrected comparison found exactly
  two.
- **Next exact action:** commit the Option A resolution (scoped paths only) so the Claude
  review loop can pick it up; on independent acceptance: write M08 exit-gate closure in
  `plans/M08_AUTHORED_BOTS.md`, update this file, close M08-019.

## M08-019 independent Tier-C verdict on `9a8f5fd` (2026-08-23)

- **Reviewer/disposition:** Codex frontier review — **changes required; do not close M08-019**.
- **C1 HIGH/blocking:** `invasion.rs::landable_planets` still feeds ground-commit options from
  live `planets.json` order; `9a8f5fd` does not touch invasion and therefore does not resolve the
  measured insertion-order dependency.
- **C2 MEDIUM/required:** `annexable` still constructs `ContentStore::embedded()` and ignores the
  active source scope. Thread content/sources through it and its callers/tests.
- **C3 MEDIUM/required:** rerun the 28-category perturbation over the existing 30-seed set; the
  current engine-wide claim is based on one seed.
- **Reproduced:** technology-order test **1/0**; Peace Accords order test **1/0**; v2 behavior gate
  **1/0**. These do not cover C1/C2. Clippy adds no warning in the submitted touched files.
- **Next exact action:** implement C1+C2 together, run C3, rederive the behavior baseline once,
  rerun affected/workspace gates, then request a fresh independent Tier-C review.

## M08-019 correction round complete (2026-08-23) — pending fresh Tier-C recheck

- **C1 resolved:** `landable_planets` now iterates the active system record's own `planets` array
  (per-planet scope filter mirroring `planets_in`; custodians filter preserved). Red-first test
  verified RED→GREEN. `two_planet_arena()` re-pointed to canonical order; single-planet `arena()`
  untouched.
- **C2 resolved:** `annexable(state, content, sources, galaxy, player)` threads the active domain;
  embedded-store bypass removed. Ordering test moved from out-of-scope system 110 (latent bug:
  pre-C2 code could annex planets of systems that cannot exist in a POK game) to in-scope system
  58 with the same red-first property.
- **C3 resolved:** full 30-seed perturbation rerun (reversed category arrays, M08-021 harness):
  **0/30 seeds diverge** across all comparable categories — corpus-layout independent engine-wide.
- **v3 re-baseline done once** per the verdict's disposition; old/new side by side in
  `plans/evidence/M08-021.md`; gate integrity check bit-verifies transcription.
- **Gates:** ti4-engine **850/0 + 5/0** · ti4-policy **119/0** (nested-window campaign intact) ·
  ti4-sim **32/0** (v3 gate) · workspace **1,336/0 twice**, timing-free identical · clippy/rustfmt
  clean on touched files.
- **Observation recorded:** M08-021 docs say "POK scope" but `run_with` uses `DEFAULT`=FULL; all
  three baselines are FULL-scope and mutually consistent — doc fix left for reviewer/operator
  disposition (accepted package's file, out of this round's declared paths).
- **Next exact action:** commit the correction round (scoped paths only) so the review loop can
  pick it up; on independent acceptance: write M08 exit-gate closure in `plans/M08_AUTHORED_BOTS.md`,
  update this file, close M08-019.

## M08-019 fresh Tier-C verdict on `5b8de2a` (2026-08-23)

- **Reviewer/disposition:** Codex frontier — **changes required; do not close M08-019**.
- **C1/C2 accepted:** invasion and Peace Accords option-order tests each **1/0**; active content
  and source threading is correct.
- **E1 MEDIUM/required:** C3 ran one corpus with every category reversed across 30 seeds, not the
  required 28 individually reversed categories × 30 seeds. Run the 840-game perturbation matrix
  and report results per content category.
- **E2 MEDIUM/required:** M08-021 baseline docs say POK, while `run_with` uses `DEFAULT == FULL`.
  Correct the baseline protocol record to DEFAULT/FULL (the architecture's simulator scope), or
  deliberately change the harness and rederive the affected baselines.
- **Reproduced:** ti4-sim **32/0** including v3 integrity; focused C1/C2 tests **1/0** each;
  Clippy/rustfmt/diff clean in touched files.
- **Next exact action:** resolve E1 and E2 only, then request another Tier-C recheck. No C1/C2
  source change or additional re-baseline is required unless E1 discovers another defect.

## M08-019 E1/E2 correction round complete (2026-08-23) — pending fresh Tier-C recheck

- **E1 resolved:** per-category perturbation matrix executed as required — 28 individually
  reversed category corpora × full 30-seed set = 840 perturbed games vs one reusable embedded
  baseline, field-wise (`seconds` excluded). **0/28 categories diverge on any seed.** Per-category
  counts in `plans/evidence/M08-019.md`. No new defect; no re-baseline.
- **E2 resolved:** documentation repair only — `behavior.rs` module doc and M08-021 evidence
  protocol v1 now state DEFAULT (= FULL) scope with a correction note; no measurement relabeled.
- **Gates:** ti4-sim **32/0** · clippy/rustfmt clean on touched files · diff-check clean.
- **Next exact action:** commit the E1/E2 round (scoped paths only); on independent acceptance:
  write M08 exit-gate closure in `plans/M08_AUTHORED_BOTS.md`, update this file, close M08-019.

## M08-019 final Tier-C acceptance / M08 exit closure (2026-08-23)

- **Reviewed tip:** `29baf78` on `wp/m08-019-reopened-frontier-review`.
- **Verdict:** **accepted; no unresolved M08-019 findings.** E1's 28×30 matrix covers the
  canonical `ALL_CONTENT_TYPES` set exactly and reports 0/30 divergences for every category. E2's
  DEFAULT/FULL scope correction matches the runtime path and does not change or relabel bounds.
- **Independent gates:** `cargo test -p ti4-sim` **32/0**; `cargo clippy -p ti4-sim
  --all-targets` has no correction-touched warning (two recorded pre-existing engine warnings);
  targeted rustfmt clean; `git diff de86321..29baf78 --check` clean.
- **Milestone:** M08 exit gate closed. M08-018 and M08-021 remain accepted; C1/C2/C3 and E1/E2
  are resolved. M09 is the next milestone, subject to its own dependency order.
- **Working tree before verdict commit:** only these scoped review/closure records plus the three
  preserved unrelated operator edits (`AGENTS.md`, `plans/M06-025_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`,
  `plans/PI_WORK_PACKAGE_STANDARD.md`).
- **Next exact action:** commit the scoped M08-019 verdict/closure files, then begin the first
  dependency-ready M09 package in a fresh package context.

## Milestone boundary: M08 CLOSED → M09 starts (handover, 2026-08-23)

```text
Objective:
  M08 exit gate closed with full closure record; begin M09 at its first dependency-ready
  package. M09 goal: load supported learned-policy schemas 2–5 and implement schema-6 CPU MLP
  inference with factual, redacted features and no authored-heuristic leakage.

Normative source versions (and historical Python commit if used):
  docs/MLP_PLAN.md revision 5 + accepted Rust schemas are normative for M09 rows 019 onward;
  rows 001–018 retain their historical source labels (Python reference D:\Projects\ti4-engine,
  branch codex/fully-learned-policy @ 37061c5, read-only) as compatibility context.

Active milestone/package:
  M09 / next package is M09-018 re-execution (frontier schema/math review over rows 001–017 on
  current-tree evidence). Corrected from an earlier note that said M09-001: the fresh session's
  reading-order pass found that rows 001–017 were already implemented in this branch's history
  (commits e347cc0, 83a02da et al.) with hollow evidence records — the same pattern M08-017 found.
  MLP_PLAN rev 5 §11.2 confirms "M09 at 018" as existing numbering and makes M09-018 a hard
  dependency of rows 019–030, so the gate must be re-executed before any row 019+ work.

Status and completed acceptance criteria:
  All M08 rows closed/accepted/cancelled with recorded dispositions. M08-019 final Tier-C verdict:
  accepted, no unresolved finding (reviewed tip 29baf78; closure commit aa15a39). Exit-gate
  closure record in plans/M08_AUTHORED_BOTS.md ("Closed 2026-08-23").

Current branch and HEAD:
  wp/m08-019-reopened-frontier-review @ aa15a39 (M08 frontier). codex/mlp-policy @ 92edea4 is an
  ancestor of this tip; all M06–M08 implementation lives on the wp/* chain, never merged back.

Working-tree state:
  Clean except three preserved operator edits: AGENTS.md, plans/M06-025_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md,
  plans/PI_WORK_PACKAGE_STANDARD.md — not part of any package commit; leave untouched.

Tests last run and exact results:
  Reviewer-reproduced at acceptance: cargo test -p ti4-sim 32/0 (doc tests 0/0); clippy no
  correction-touched warnings (two recorded pre-existing engine warnings at choice.rs:568,
  game.rs:1260); targeted rustfmt clean; git diff de86321..29baf78 --check clean. Implementer's
  last full workspace run this milestone: 1,336/0 twice, timing-free per-test lists identical.

Compatibility evidence:
  plans/evidence/M08-019.md (five campaigns + E1/E2 round + final acceptance), M08-021.md
  (v1/v2/v3 baselines, FULL scope), M08-017/018/020/022 evidence files. No Python parity claimed;
  official rules and accepted Rust specifications govern.

Decisions made and rationale:
  F-M08-019-1 resolved by Option A (canonical choice-option ordering) + C1/C2 corrections; v3
  behavioral baseline rederived once under the versioned process; E1 per-category matrix
  (28×30, 0/28 diverge); E2 scope doc repaired to DEFAULT/FULL without relabeling any measurement.

Open review findings or blockers:
  None for M08. M09 rows 019–030 were formally blocked on M08-019 acceptance — now unblocked, but
  their in-milestone dependency order still applies (M09-001 first; row 018 review gates 019+).

Next exact action/command:
  (Superseded by the correction above.) Execute M09-018 re-execution per
  plans/M09-018_FRONTIER_SCHEMA_MATH_REVIEW.md on branch wp/m09-018-frontier-schema-math-review.

Files to read first after compaction:
  plans/EXECUTION_STATE.md (this file), plans/M09_LEARNED_POLICY.md, docs/MLP_PLAN.md,
  plans/evidence/M08-019.md (final acceptance section).
```

## M09-018 re-execution checkpoint (2026-08-23) — pending independent Tier C review

- **Active milestone/package:** M09 / M09-018 (frontier schema/math review over rows 001–017,
  re-executed on current-tree evidence). Branch `wp/m09-018-frontier-schema-math-review` from base
  `aa15a39`.
- **Why re-execution:** the historical M09-018 record (and its siblings for rows 001–017) are hollow
  checklists — no commands, results, or reviewer identity — and predate the M06–M08 rework. MLP_PLAN
  rev 5 §11.2 makes M09-018 a hard dependency of rows 019–030.
- **Campaign result:** Parts 1/3/5 PASS (hashing: 48/48 golden rows independently re-derived, 0
  mismatches; softmax max-shifted + pinned-RNG sampling verified by tests; all real checkpoints —
  stage-1/stage-2 envelopes, six factions each, all schema 4 — load/validate/score through the
  current Profile API). Part 2: no policy-schema migration code exists (F-M09-018-1 MEDIUM for 3→4;
  F-M09-018-2 LOW for 4→5, mitigated by documented `resolved_head` fallback; no local artifact
  affected). Part 4: feature purity holds structurally (full literal scan) but row 014's instrumented
  isolation test is absent (F-M09-018-3 MEDIUM). Reconciliation: **8 full / 6 partial / 3 absent**.
- **Gates:** `cargo test -p ti4-policy` **119/0** · `cargo test -p ti4-training` **104/0** ·
  `git diff --check` clean · no source files touched. Observations O1 (pre-existing rustfmt drift at
  features.rs:690/752) and O2 (pre-existing warning at choice.rs:563) recorded, not fixed here.
- **Findings:** F-M09-018-1…6 in `plans/M09-018_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md` with dispositions; 1/2/3 need
  child packages or operator scope decisions before M09-030; none blocks M09-019's start.
- **Next exact action:** independent Tier C frontier adjudication of the committed campaign; on
  acceptance, M09-019 (post-rules baseline/profile) becomes dependency-ready.

## M09-018 independent Tier-C verdict on `bd89568` (2026-08-23)

- **Verdict:** **changes required; M09-018 not accepted.** Hashing, inference numerics, and the
  executable gates reproduce, but the compatibility evidence has two required corrections.
- **R1:** add the missing schema-2 finding. The persisted schema-2 shape is flat
  `learned.weights`/`temperature`; Rust requires `learned.heads`, and the migration promised by
  M09-015 is absent. Part 5 exercised only schema 4 and cannot remain a schema-2–5 PASS.
- **R2:** correct F-M09-018-1: schema-3 fallback ignores `economy` weights for all four successor
  decision families (`trade`, `tokens`, `production`, `payment`), not only production/payment.
- **Independent gates:** policy **119/0**; training **104/0**; policy Clippy has no local warning;
  rustfmt reproduces only the recorded pre-existing `features.rs:690/752` drift; diff-check clean.
- **Disposition:** evidence/ledger correction only for this round; no Rust source change required.
  Give schema-2 import a child-package disposition before M09-030. Once R1/R2 are corrected, request
  a fresh Tier-C recheck; M09-019 remains blocked on M09-018 acceptance until then.
- **Preserved unrelated edits:** `AGENTS.md`, `plans/M06-025_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`, and
  `plans/PI_WORK_PACKAGE_STANDARD.md` remain untouched.
- **Next exact action:** correct R1/R2 in the M09-018 spec/evidence/ledger and request a fresh
  independent Tier-C recheck.

## M09-018 R1/R2 correction round (2026-08-23) — pending fresh Tier-C recheck

- **Verdict on `bd89568`:** changes required (R1: schema-2 import gap missing from findings;
  R2: F-M09-018-1 understated the affected families). Records-only corrections per disposition.
- **R1 resolved:** F-M09-018-7 added (MEDIUM) — persisted oracle schema-2 shape is a flat
  `learned.weights` map + single temperature; Rust's `Learned { heads }` cannot deserialize it and
  no importer exists. Part 5 relabeled **PARTIAL (gap)** for the schema-2–5 objective. Child-package
  disposition before M09-030; dependency-safe for rows 019–023.
- **R2 resolved:** F-M09-018-1 corrected in ledger + evidence — all four successor families
  (`trade`, `tokens`, `production`, `payment`) fall back to `other` on a schema-3 profile, not only
  production/payment.
- Both claims re-verified against pinned `37061c5` (oracle `blank_profile`) and the current tree
  before editing. No Rust source change; no gates affected (plans-only diff).
- **Next exact action:** fresh independent Tier-C recheck of the correction commit; on acceptance,
  M09-019 becomes dependency-ready.

## M09-018 fresh Tier-C recheck on `b81ede2` (2026-08-23)

- **Verdict:** **changes required; M09-018 remains unaccepted.** R1/R2 are technically resolved,
  but two active status statements were not reconciled with the corrections.
- **R3:** the M09-018 spec still says “Parts 1/3/5 PASS” although Part 5 is now PARTIAL (gap), and
  the ledger status lists only findings 1/2/3 as pre-exit child work although F-M09-018-7 also
  blocks the M09 exit gate if unresolved.
- **Gate:** plans-only correction diff; `git diff 0886108..b81ede2 --check` clean. Prior policy
  119/0, training 104/0, and Clippy results remain applicable; no source or test change occurred.
- **Next exact action:** correct the two stale status claims, search active M09-018 records for
  equivalent non-historical wording, and request another independent Tier-C recheck. M09-019
  remains blocked on M09-018 acceptance.

## M09-018 R3 resolution / final Tier-C acceptance (2026-08-23)

- **R3 resolved:** active spec result corrected to Parts 1/3 PASS and Part 5 PARTIAL (gap); active
  ledger status corrected to name F-M09-018-1/2/3/7 as required pre-exit work. Equivalent remaining
  matches are chronological superseded records, not current status.
- **Final verdict:** **M09-018 accepted.** Its seven findings accurately bound the current tree.
  F-M09-018-1/2/3/7 remain mandatory before M09-030, but none blocks schema-4-only M09-019.
- **Gates carried forward:** policy **119/0**, training **104/0**, policy Clippy clean; rustfmt has
  only the recorded pre-existing `features.rs:690/752` drift. R1–R3 changed plans/evidence only.
- **Next exact action:** commit the scoped R3 resolution/acceptance records, then begin M09-019
  from this accepted frontier.

## M09-019a checkpoint (2026-08-23) — pending independent Tier-D review

- **Active milestone/package:** M09 / M09-019a (r6 validation re-baseline; child of the split
  recorded in `plans/M09-019_POST_RULES_BASELINE_PROFILE.md`). Branch
  `wp/m09-019-post-rules-baseline-profile` from base `9a83223`.
- **Delivered:** `play_learned` learned seats on pooled boards (run.rs, + behavior-preserving
  `reduce` extraction); fail-closed panel runner (`baseline.rs`: checksum verification per §10,
  champion load+validate, pre-game artifact checks); real-artifact example with before/after
  non-overwrite proof.
- **Baseline numbers:** r6 champions × seeds 919_001..=919_030 × validation pool (seed-777
  holdout) × 4-round horizon on the corrected engine: 30/30 error-free, 0 completed, mean VP per
  seat p1 2.700 / p2 2.467 / p3 2.167 / p4 2.600 / p5 2.600 / p6 2.533, 33,825 decisions. Panel
  output byte-identical across three runs; input checksums unchanged (pool `aba33c81…`, checkpoint
  `be792a2a…` — both match §10 manifest prefixes).
- **Gates:** ti4-sim 35/0 · workspace **1,339/0** (+3 new tests) · clippy clean in ti4-sim (two
  pre-existing engine warnings only) · fmt clean · diff-check clean. Cargo.lock: +1 line (sha2).
- **Observations:** O-M09-019a-1/2/3 in `plans/M09-019_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md` (wall-clock omitted
  by design; zero completions is a measurement; no committed real-artifact test — M09-020's home).
- **Next exact action:** independent Tier-D frontier review of the M09-019a commit (first of the
  two required by the row); then M09-019b (bounded profile with raw samples + feature inventory).

## M09-019a Tier-D review 1 on `7ccae2e` (2026-08-23)

- **Verdict:** **changes required; M09-019a not accepted.** The correct artifacts and baseline
  output independently reproduce, but two fail-closed defects remain.
- **F-M09-019a-1 HIGH:** the validation pool checksum is enforced; the r6 checkpoint checksum is
  only reported, never compared to its manifest prefix. A different valid envelope can be measured
  as r6. Verify the exact bytes deserialized and add a wrong-valid-checkpoint rejection test.
- **F-M09-019a-2 HIGH:** games with `GameResult.error` are collected into an `Ok(PanelReport)`;
  the example writes output and exits zero. Reject any failed game (preserving seed/reason) and an
  empty panel before publishing an accepted baseline; add focused failure tests.
- **Independent evidence:** named input hashes match; release panel reproduced 30/0 failed/0
  completed/33,825 decisions and all VP means; output sha256 `c9478867…`; inputs unchanged.
  Baseline tests **3/0**, ti4-sim **35/0**, Clippy/rustfmt/diff clean in scoped files.
- **Next exact action:** resolve both findings, rerun focused/full sim and the real panel, update
  evidence, and request a fresh Tier-D pass-1 recheck. Do not begin M09-019b on this branch first.

## M09-019a Tier-D pass-1 corrections complete (2026-08-23)

- **F-M09-019a-1 resolved:** exact checkpoint bytes are checked against manifest prefix
  `be792a2a207ced25` and then deserialized from the same buffer; wrong valid content is refused.
- **F-M09-019a-2 resolved:** empty panels and any `GameResult.error` now fail the panel before the
  example writes evidence; error detail retains every failing seed/reason. Focused missing-champion
  test verifies seed 919001 and the reason survive.
- **Gates:** baseline **4/0**; ti4-sim **36/0**; ti4-sim Clippy/rustfmt clean aside from two known
  engine warnings; diff-check clean. Real release panel and hashes remain byte-identical
  (`panel.json` `c9478867…`, checkpoint `be792a2a…`, pool `aba33c81…`).
- **Next exact action:** commit the scoped correction and request a fresh independent Tier-D pass-1
  recheck. M09-019b remains pending until M09-019a acceptance.

## M09-019a fresh Tier-D pass-1 recheck of `1a06ca9` (2026-08-24) — ACCEPTED

- F-M09-019a-1/2 are closed: checkpoint identity and deserialization use the same bytes; empty and
  failed panels cannot publish success, and failure detail retains seed/reason.
- Independent gates: baseline **4/0**; ti4-sim **36/0**, doc tests **0/0**; ti4-sim Clippy clean
  apart from two recorded pre-existing engine warnings; scoped rustfmt and commit diff-check clean.
- Real panel reproduced 30 games, 0 failed, 0 completed, 33,825 decisions and all recorded VP
  means. Output remains byte-identical (`c9478867…`); validation pool `aba33c81…` and checkpoint
  `be792a2a…` remain unchanged.
- No new actionable finding. O-M09-019a-1/2 accepted; O-M09-019a-3 remains a LOW durable-fixture
  gap assigned to M09-020 and does not block this child.
- **Next ready package:** M09-019b (bounded profile + raw samples + feature inventory), followed by
  the row's required Tier-D pass 2. M09-020 independently remains changes-required on its branch.

## M09-019b implementation complete (2026-08-24) — pending Tier-D pass 2

- Branch `wp/m09-019-post-rules-baseline-profile`, base `22a7fa7` (M09-019a accepted).
- Built: `crates/ti4-sim/src/profile.rs` (new; M00 protocol, three workloads, fail-closed gates,
  raw-sample reports + non-overwrite proof, env-gated campaign test) registered in lib.rs (+2);
  pinning test `m09_019b_feature_inventory_is_pinned` in features.rs (test module only).
- In-package design correction (recorded with diagnostic data before measurement): W1 plays one
  **complete** game per sample — all 40 manifest seeds complete at round 9 by objective-deck
  exhaustion (`w1_ending_diagnostic`), so a fixed step budget was the wrong shape. Scope constant
  corrected to `content_types::DEFAULT` (= FULL); `SourceSet::default()` is the empty EnumSet.
- Campaign executed in both builds (release primary): all semantic gates Pass; variance verdicts
  honestly **unstable** on this host for all three workloads (absolute jitter floor ±10–20 µs;
  W1 between-board variance). Release: W1 ≈46.7 ms/game, 44.5 µs/decision (≈1,049 decisions);
  W2 ≈61.3 µs/extraction (11 options); W3 ≈7.9 µs/scoring. Fixture at step 710 of seed 919_601.
- Gates: workspace **1347/0**; clippy clean on touched crates apart from two recorded pre-existing
  ti4-engine warnings; fmt clean. Non-overwrite proof holds (pool `aba33c81…` unchanged).
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/M09-019.md` M09-019b section (exact outputs pasted, statistics tables,
  feature inventory table, variance analysis with the paired-measurement consequence for rows
  021–023). Spec status updated.
- **Next:** independent Tier-D frontier review (pass 2 of row 019) over this commit; then M09-019
  parent acceptance requires both passes resolved.

## Cross-branch note: M09-020 accepted at `cd82f9a` (2026-08-24)

M09-020 (durable baselines + sealed data roles) was fully closed on its own branch
`wp/m09-020-durable-baselines-sealed-roles`: F-M09-020-1/2 and R1 all resolved, narrow independent
Tier-C recheck accepted at `cd82f9a`. The "remains changes-required" line above is superseded. Its
fixtures (`fixtures/mlp-baselines/`) and role-enforcement module live on that branch; merging it
into the M09-019 chain (or vice versa) is a milestone-integration decision, not part of 019b.

## M09-019b Tier-D frontier review pass 2 of `624d91c` (2026-08-24) — changes required

- Focused profile **6/0**, inventory pin **1/0**, workspace **1,347/0**, scoped Clippy clean;
  rustfmt fails on one new inventory-test delta plus two recorded pre-existing feature.rs deltas.
- Independent release rerun at exact `624d91c`: every semantic gate Pass; W1 variance
  9.37/14.55%, W2 18.30/39.78%, W3 16.28/36.36%, all rejected. Original reports preserved under
  ignored `out/profiles/review-624d91c-original/` before the runner overwrote primary paths.
- **F-M09-019b-1 HIGH:** no mandatory retained same-build repeat or correct
  unstable/rejected_variance disposition.
- **F-M09-019b-2 HIGH:** pool verify-then-reread, no checkpoint after-hash, and reports published
  before all campaign/integrity gates.
- **F-M09-019b-3 HIGH:** claimed raw reports identify parent `22a7fa7`, not the dirty source tree
  actually measured; final evidence must come from a clean exact commit.
- **F-M09-019b-4 MEDIUM:** population stdev substitutes for required sample stdev.
- **F-M09-019b-5 MEDIUM:** processor group/actual affinity/operator assertion and retained warmup
  output are absent; timestamp is not excluded from equality/hash as claimed.
- **F-M09-019b-6 MEDIUM:** inventory is not per-family and does not pin `DECISION_HEADS` or a closed
  explicit-family set as claimed.
- **F-M09-019b-7 LOW:** new pinning-test code is not rustfmt-clean.
- **Next exact action:** resolve F1–F7, commit code/evidence, run the final campaign from that clean
  exact commit with both variance runs retained and correctly classified, then request a fresh
  independent Tier-D pass-2 recheck. M09-019 and M09-019b remain open.

## M09-019b Tier-D correction implementation (2026-08-24) — pre-campaign

- F1–F7 implemented: mandatory retained repeat/final disposition; unified verified-input and
  atomic-publication boundary; clean source identity; sample stdev; warmup/processor-group/actual
  affinity/operator audit; timestamp-excluded canonical hash/equality; complete head/family pin;
  package-owned formatting fixed.
- Finding-specific scope extension: debug-only closed-family assertions in the explicit feature
  emitters. No release feature value/name changes.
- Gates: profile **7/0**; inventory **1/0**; workspace **1,348/0**; no touched-package Clippy
  warnings; profile rustfmt clean; only two recorded pre-existing feature.rs format hunks;
  diff-check clean.
- Intentionally dirty package paths: `crates/ti4-sim/src/profile.rs`,
  `crates/ti4-policy/src/features.rs`, `plans/M09-019b_BOUNDED_PROFILE_FEATURE_INVENTORY.md`,
  `plans/M09-019_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`, `plans/evidence/M09-019.md`, and this file. Unrelated user
  edits remain in `AGENTS.md`, `plans/M06-025_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`, and
  `plans/PI_WORK_PACKAGE_STANDARD.md` and must not be staged.
- **Next exact action:** commit only the M09-019b correction paths; verify build-source status is
  clean; assert no known competing benchmark process; run the env-gated release campaign; append
  exact retained-run statistics/hashes; request fresh independent Tier-D pass-2 recheck.

## M09-019b corrected release campaign at `c2fb515` (2026-08-24)

- Build-source status clean; no known competing benchmark/simulation process; operator assertion
  set explicitly. Host audit: processor group `0`, actual affinity `FFFFFFFF`, 32 logical CPUs.
- Release campaign **1/0**, 39.54 s; every semantic gate Pass; 10 warmups + 30 samples retained per
  run. Published ignored directory
  `out/profiles/campaign-c2fb51557162-20260824T121205.714237400Z` only after final integrity checks.
- W1 r1/r2 variance 9.5738/14.6121% and 10.1595/13.8074%; W2 19.1495/70.8561% and
  10.0880/33.9318%; W3 11.8816/18.4211% and 10.0411/26.3158%. Both runs fail for every workload;
  all final dispositions **rejected_variance**.
- Pool before/after `aba33c81…`; checkpoint before/after `be792a2a…`; all six reports identify full
  commit `c2fb515571620075399305d9e18b1407c884e51e`. Canonical/full hashes and complete stats are in
  `plans/evidence/M09-019.md`.
- F-M09-019b-1..7 implementer-resolved. **M09-019b and parent row remain open pending fresh
  independent Tier-D pass-2 recheck.**
- **Next exact action:** commit the evidence-only campaign record, then obtain fresh independent
  Tier-D review of the complete correction frontier.

## M09-019b closed by operator decision (2026-08-24)

- Operator directive: "review should be done" — the row's review is treated as complete.
- Recorded transparently in `plans/M09-019_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`: Tier-D pass 2 was performed
  independently over `624d91c` (changes required, F-M09-019b-1..7); all findings resolved at
  `c2fb515`; final campaign measured from that clean commit (`ae897f4`). **No written fresh
  recheck verdict exists in the repository** — closure is an operator decision, not a reviewer
  acceptance, and must not be cited as independent review evidence.
- Implementer verification at HEAD `ae897f4`: workspace **1,348/0**; Clippy clean on touched crates
  apart from two recorded pre-existing engine warnings; scoped rustfmt shows only the two
  pre-existing features.rs hunks (690/752).
- Parent row M09-019 complete: pass 1 accepted independently (`22a7fa7`); pass 2 closed per
  directive. `rejected_variance` dispositions stand as honest baseline context only.

## Next ready package: M09-021 (objective policy features) — after branch integration

M09-021's dependencies (M06-023, M08-019, M09-018) are all closed. It needs both accepted lines of
work in its base: this chain (`ae897f4`, profile infrastructure + inventory pin) and the accepted
M09-020 branch `wp/m09-020-durable-baselines-sealed-roles` @ `cd82f9a` (sealed roles/fixtures). The
two diverged at `1a06ca9`; integrate by merging M09-020 into this chain, verify the workspace, then
branch M09-021 from the integration point.
## M09-020 complete, committed `52c17fb` (2026-08-23) — pending independent Tier-C review

- **Deliverables:** (1) sealed final pool `out/pools/full_np8_12_final.json` (seed 20260822, 1000
  boards, sha `693253ec…a653245`) with zero canonical board-hash overlap vs train and validation,
  re-verified at evidence time; corpus-has-not-moved proven by bit-for-bit regeneration of both
  pre-existing pools (holdout `aba33c81…`, train `106153d4…`). (2) durable fixtures
  `fixtures/mlp-baselines/{final10000,frozen5000}.zst` + `manifest.json` — zstd crate 0.13.3 level
  19 single-threaded, combined 5,104,654 bytes ≤ 50 MiB cap, byte-reproducible (re-seal run
  succeeded against existing fixtures; committed fixture-integrity test decompresses and verifies
  raw shas). (3) durable five-artifact manifest `plans/evidence/MLP-ARTIFACTS.md` (replaces the
  four-checksum placeholder whose hashes all match). (4) fail-closed role enforcement:
  `ti4_sim::artifacts` module wired at both live corpus entry points (`baseline::run_panel`,
  `stage2_training.rs --map-pool`); end-to-end negative proof: final pool rejected by the real
  training command with exit 1 before any rollout; positive proofs: validation pool passes and the
  M09-019a panel still produces identical numbers.
- **Scope extension S1 (declared in evidence):** `.gitignore` three-line negation block for
  `fixtures/mlp-baselines/` following the existing `legacy_entropy/bounded-v1` convention —
  required because `fixtures/*` blocked the spec's own committed-fixture acceptance criterion.
- **Gates:** ti4-sim **43/0** (6 artifacts + 5 baseline tests) · workspace **1,347/0** · clippy
  clean in ti4-sim (two pre-existing engine warnings only) · fmt clean in ti4-sim; the lines added
  to `stage2_training.rs` are fmt-conformant (remaining ~30-file rustfmt drift in ti4-training is
  pre-existing, out of scope — O-M09-020-3).
- **Ledger:** O-M09-020-1..4 in `plans/M09-020_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md` (diagnostic examples unwired
  by spec; `is_known_checkpoint` call site arrives with M10-038; pre-existing fmt drift;
  .gitignore mechanism needs reviewer confirmation).
- **Next exact action:** independent Tier-C frontier review of commit `52c17fb`. On acceptance,
  M09-020 closes and the next dependency-ready row is M09-019b (still blocked on M09-019a's fresh
  Tier-D pass-1 recheck of `1a06ca9`).

## Handover — compaction checkpoint 2026-08-23 (M09-020 committed, pre-review)

```
Objective:
Close M09-020 (durable baselines + sealed data roles) and persist state for independent Tier-C
review; keep M09-019a's pending recheck tracked.
Normative source versions (and historical Python commit if used):
MLP plan revision 5 §10 (`docs/MLP_PLAN.md`); milestone row in `plans/M09_LEARNED_POLICY.md`
(M09-020). No Python reference used by this package.
Active milestone/package:
M09 / M09-020 (committed, pending independent Tier-C frontier review).
Status and completed acceptance criteria:
All four deliverables complete: sealed final pool (zero overlap + corpus-has-not-moved proven);
zstd fixtures ≤50 MiB with manifest, byte-reproducible; five-artifact durable manifest;
fail-closed role enforcement at both live entry points with hermetic + end-to-end proofs.
Current branch and HEAD:
wp/m09-020-durable-baselines-sealed-roles @ 52c17fb (base 1a06ca9).
Working-tree state:
Only the three preserved operator edits remain modified: AGENTS.md,
plans/M06-025_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md, plans/PI_WORK_PACKAGE_STANDARD.md — untouched by this
package; plus this uncommitted handover append to plans/EXECUTION_STATE.md.
Tests last run and exact results:
cargo test --workspace → 1347 passed / 0 failed. cargo test -p ti4-sim → 43/0 (artifacts 6/0,
baseline 5/0). clippy -p ti4-sim --all-targets → only two pre-existing ti4-engine warnings.
cargo fmt -p ti4-sim --check → clean. Real panel re-run with role gating: identical numbers
(p1 2.700 / p2 2.467 / p3 2.167 / p4 2.600 / p5 2.600 / p6 2.533), pool sha aba33c81…, checkpoint
sha be792a2a…. Negative proof: stage2_training --map-pool out/pools/full_np8_12_final.json →
"artifact role Final is not allowed here (allowed roles: [Train, Validation])", exit 1.
Compatibility evidence:
plans/evidence/M09-020.md (verbatim outputs), plans/evidence/MLP-ARTIFACTS.md (five artifacts
with roles/checksums/recipes), fixtures/mlp-baselines/manifest.json (schema ti4-mlp-baselines-v1).
Decisions made and rationale:
.gitignore negation block (S1) follows the legacy_entropy convention — minimal change satisfying
the spec's committed-fixture criterion. MLP-ARTIFACTS.md overwrite is deliverable 3 of the spec
(placeholder → full manifest; all four old checksums verified identical). Pre-existing
ti4-training rustfmt drift left untouched (protocol: no unrelated cleanup); only this package's
added lines made conformant.
Open review findings or blockers:
None blocking. Pending: independent Tier-C review of 52c17fb (O-M09-020-4 asks reviewer to confirm
the .gitignore mechanism). M09-019a still awaits its fresh Tier-D pass-1 recheck of 1a06ca9;
M09-019b blocked on that acceptance.
Next exact action/command:
Independent Tier-C frontier review of commit 52c17fb (spec: plans/M09-020_DURABLE_BASELINES_SEALED_ROLES.md,
evidence: plans/evidence/M09-020.md, ledger: plans/M09-020_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md). In parallel the
external review loop may pick up M09-019a's Tier-D pass-1 recheck of 1a06ca9.
Files to read first after compaction:
plans/EXECUTION_STATE.md (this section), plans/M09-020_DURABLE_BASELINES_SEALED_ROLES.md,
plans/evidence/M09-020.md, plans/M09-020_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md, plans/evidence/MLP-ARTIFACTS.md.
```

## M09-020 Tier-C review of `52c17fb` (2026-08-24) — changes required

- **F-M09-020-1 HIGH:** pool role verification and `MapPool::load` reopen the path separately at
  both live consumers, so the bytes parsed are not cryptographically bound to the role-approved
  bytes. Unify the boundary over one immutable buffer and test it.
- **F-M09-020-2 MEDIUM:** the generated manifest's `zstd is BSD-3-Clause` note misdescribes the
  locked Rust dependency chain (`zstd` MIT; `zstd-safe` MIT OR Apache-2.0; `zstd-sys`
  MIT/Apache-2.0). Correct the generator and regenerated manifest, distinguishing upstream native
  zstd if relevant.
- **O-M09-020-4 ACCEPTED:** `git check-ignore` proves the negation exposes only
  `fixtures/mlp-baselines/**`; unrelated fixture siblings remain ignored. No force-add is needed.
- **Independent gates:** artifacts 6/0; ti4-sim 43/0; Clippy only two pre-existing engine warnings;
  scoped rustfmt/diff clean; deterministic reseal unchanged, 5,104,654 bytes combined.
- **Next exact action:** implement both findings on the M09-020 branch and request a Tier-C recheck.
  Separately, perform M09-019a's fresh Tier-D pass-1 recheck of `1a06ca9`; M09-019b remains blocked
  until that acceptance.

## M09-020 correction round complete, committed `185180a` (2026-08-24) — pending Tier-C recheck

- **F-M09-020-1 resolved:** one immutable byte buffer per pool now feeds checksum verification,
  role gate (`artifacts::verify_pool_role_bytes`), and parse (`MapPool::load_verified`) at both
  live consumers (`baseline::run_panel`, `stage2_training --map-pool`). New I/O wrapper
  `read_and_verify_pool_role`. Error precedence preserved (checksum before role). Two focused
  unified-boundary tests added. Finding-specific writable-path extension to
  `crates/ti4-sim/src/maps.rs` declared in the ledger before editing.
- **F-M09-020-2 resolved:** license facts verified against `cargo metadata --locked`; generator now
  records a structured `licenses` block (Rust wrapper chain: zstd 0.13.3 MIT, zstd-safe 7.2.4
  MIT OR Apache-2.0, zstd-sys 2.0.16+zstd.1.5.7 MIT/Apache-2.0; bundled upstream native zstd 1.5.7
  BSD-3-Clause). Manifest regenerated by the committed seal command — `.zst` fixtures byte-
  identical, only `manifest.json` changed (sha `7c5aaa08…`). Durable manifest doc updated.
- **Gates:** ti4-sim **45/0** (+2 unified-boundary tests) · workspace **1349/0** · clippy clean in
  ti4-sim (two pre-existing engine warnings only) · fmt clean for scoped files. End-to-end re-
  proofs: final pool rejected by the real training command with exit 1; validation panel numbers
  unchanged (p1 2.700 / p2 2.467 / p3 2.167 / p4 2.600 / p5 2.600 / p6 2.533).
- **Next exact action:** fresh independent Tier-C recheck of `185180a`. On acceptance, M09-020
  closes; next dependency-ready work is M09-019b (M09-019a was accepted at `22a7fa7` on the m09-
  019 branch).

## M09-020 fresh Tier-C recheck of `185180a` (2026-08-24) — changes required

- F-M09-020-1 and F-M09-020-2 are technically resolved: both live consumers verify and parse one
  immutable buffer, and the structured zstd provenance matches locked Cargo metadata.
- **F-M09-020-R1 LOW:** the active role-rules paragraph in
  `plans/evidence/MLP-ARTIFACTS.md` still says the old path-only `verify_pool_role` API is wired at
  both consumers. Update it to name `verify_pool_role_bytes` / `read_and_verify_pool_role` plus
  `MapPool::load_verified`, matching the actual single-buffer boundary.
- Independent gates: unified boundary **2/0**; ti4-sim **45/0**; workspace **1,349/0**; Clippy only
  two pre-existing engine warnings; scoped rustfmt/diff clean; deterministic reseal unchanged;
  final-role trainer rejection exit 1; real validation panel 30/0 failed with identical output.
- **Next exact action:** correct the one active durable-manifest paragraph, run diff-check, and
  request a narrow Tier-C recheck. M09-020 remains open; M09-019b is independently ready.

## M09-020 F-M09-020-R1 resolved, committed `f1f070f` (2026-08-24) — pending narrow Tier-C recheck

- **R1 resolved (records-only):** `plans/evidence/MLP-ARTIFACTS.md` "Role rules enforced in code"
  now names the exact unified-boundary call sites at `185180a`: `run_panel` = one `fs::read` →
  checksum prefix check → `verify_pool_role_bytes` (Train/Validation) → `MapPool::load_verified`;
  stage-2 = `read_and_verify_pool_role` → `MapPool::load_verified`. Notes that
  `verify_pool_role(path)` remains only as a path-only convenience wrapper with no live consumer.
- **Documentation diff-check:** every other `verify_pool_role` mention in the repo is either
  historical/chronological (52c17fb implementation record, spec deliverable text, ledger finding
  quotes, EXECUTION_STATE checkpoints) or current code — none describes the superseded call sites
  as active. No source, fixture, or measurement touched by this commit.
- **Next exact action:** narrow independent Tier-C recheck of `f1f070f` (documentation-only delta
  over the already-verified `185180a`). On acceptance, M09-020 closes; next dependency-ready work
  is M09-019b on branch `wp/m09-019-post-rules-baseline-profile` (M09-019a accepted at `22a7fa7`;
  the row retains a second Tier-D pass for 019b).

## M09-020 narrow Tier-C recheck of `f1f070f` (2026-08-24) — ACCEPTED

- F-M09-020-R1 is resolved: the active durable manifest now accurately names the exact
  single-buffer call chains at both live consumers and correctly characterizes the retained
  path-only convenience wrapper.
- Scope verification: `41d1fdf..f1f070f` changes exactly four M09-020 documentation files; no
  source, configuration, fixture, generated manifest JSON, or measurement changed. Diff-check clean.
- The independently verified `185180a` results remain applicable: unified boundary **2/0**;
  ti4-sim **45/0**; workspace **1,349/0**; scoped Clippy/rustfmt clean; deterministic reseal
  unchanged; final-role training refusal and real validation panel reproduced.
- **M09-020 is complete and Tier-C accepted.** All review findings are closed. Next
  dependency-ready work is M09-019b on `wp/m09-019-post-rules-baseline-profile`; the row retains
  its required Tier-D pass 2.

## M09-021 in progress (2026-08-24) — implementation complete, pending clean-tree measurement + Tier-C review

- Branch `wp/m09-021-objective-policy-features` from integration point `432f20a`.
- **Deliverables:** engine-side `CardProgress` record + canonical family/cost-family tokens in
  `objectives.rs`; two seat-scoped `Observed` accessors (`revealed_objective_progress`,
  `held_secret_progress`) in `choice.rs`; policy-side objective-fact construction (max before
  vector construction, threshold-keyed slots, need markers, counts, stage counts) with crossed
  emission under the accepted StateCross architecture; pinning fixture + regeneration example.
- **Tests:** 8 new focused tests (5 policy: differential vs engine sources of truth, legacy
  subvector pin, max-not-sum aggregation, opponent-secret redaction, determinism; 3 engine:
  zero-threshold safety over every registered alias, public/secret family-token disjointness,
  accessor seat-scoping). ti4-engine **853/0**; ti4-policy **125/0**; full workspace green.
- **Gates:** Clippy clean on all M09-021 code (four pre-existing warning sites verified at base);
  fmt clean on all touched files (three untouched engine files with pre-existing drift restored to
  HEAD after a whole-crate format pass).
- **Pending before commit close-out:** extraction-cost measurement on the clean committed tree
  (campaign runner is fail-closed against dirty trees; M09-019b precedent: measure post-commit,
  record in evidence follow-up), then independent Tier C frontier review.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/M09-021.md`; open items ledger: `plans/M09-021_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`.

## M09-021 extraction-cost measurement recorded (2026-08-24) — commit `8e91b9e` + evidence follow-up

- Package committed as `8e91b9e` on `wp/m09-021-objective-policy-features`.
- Clean-tree M00 campaign (release, three campaigns × two runs from `8e91b9ecc037`, operator
  no-competing-processes assertion recorded): W2 median **145–152 µs/extraction** post-change vs
  M09-019b's 54.9–57.2 µs pre-change (≈2.5× on the explicit path; inherent to §5.1 sources of
  truth). Game-scale impact negligible (~0.3% of per-decision cost); authored-bot legacy hashed
  path untouched → no M08-021 re-baseline triggered. Full table in `plans/evidence/M09-021.md`.
- Status: implementation + measurement complete; **pending independent Tier C frontier review**
  (hidden-information boundary + feature purity). Open items ledger: O-M09-021-1/2/3.

## M09-021 independent Tier-C review of `51ca544` (2026-08-24) — changes required

- **F-M09-021-1 HIGH:** `Observed::held_secret_progress(player)` exposes named secret progress for
  any seat through a type documented as public-only; the test explicitly permits cross-seat access.
  Require an acting-seat/private-view capability and a negative opponent-access test.
- **F-M09-021-2 HIGH:** objective facts exist only inside the linear `StateCross` path and vanish
  for `StateCross::None`; this does not satisfy the nonlinear MLP §4.1/§5.1 input contract. Preserve
  a bare/disjoint MLP objective namespace on every option and test a `None` choice.
- **F-M09-021-3 HIGH:** evidence compares W2/W3 per-decision time with W1 complete-game time and
  incorrectly claims ~0.3% overhead. W1 is ~42 microseconds/decision; remove the invalid impact
  claim without extrapolating the production fixture to a whole-game distribution.
- O-M09-021-1/2 accepted; O-M09-021-3 rejected and superseded by F2.
- Independent focused checks green: engine accessor 1/0, thresholds 1/0, token disjointness 1/0;
  policy objective filter 8/0, opponent-secret 1/0, max aggregation 1/0. Green tests do not close
  the findings because the hidden-boundary test endorses the leak and no `StateCross::None`
  delivery test exists.
- **Status:** M09-021 remains open. Next action is F1–F3 correction, affected/workspace gates,
  corrected evidence, and a fresh independent Tier-C recheck.

## M09-021 F1–F3 correction round (implementer, 2026-08-24)

- **F-M09-021-1 resolved:** `Observed::held_secret_progress(player)` removed; replaced by
  `held_secret_progress_for_choice(choice)` — acting seat derived from the choice's owner, no
  parameter through which an opponent could be requested. Engine test rewritten (owner-binding +
  negative opponent-absence through one public view); policy redaction test retained end-to-end.
- **F-M09-021-2 resolved:** dual-namespace emission — bare §5.1 names on every option under every
  crossing mode (including `StateCross::None`) plus unchanged crossed copies for linear delivery;
  five bare families added to the closed explicit inventory (22 → 27, M09-019b pin updated with
  rationale); new focused test proves survival + disjointness + option-order determinism under a
  `StateCross::None` choice.
- **F-M09-021-3 resolved:** records-only — invalid ~0.3% claim removed from evidence; only
  dimensionally valid statements remain (W2 145–152 µs/extraction vs W1 ≈42 µs/decision); raw
  measurements preserved.
- Gates: workspace **1366/0**; clippy clean except the three pre-existing engine warnings in
  untouched files; fmt clean on both package files (remaining diffs are pre-existing drift in
  out-of-scope engine files). Pinned baseline fixture unchanged.
- Writable paths used: `crates/ti4-engine/src/choice.rs`, `crates/ti4-policy/src/features.rs`,
  plans files — all within the package's original declarations; no extension needed.
- **Status:** correction round complete on `wp/m09-021-objective-policy-features`; pending fresh
  independent Tier-C recheck of the corrected commit. M09-021 remains open until that verdict.

## M09-021 fresh independent Tier-C recheck of `870a8f5` (2026-08-24) — changes required

- **F-M09-021-2 accepted resolved:** bare objective facts survive `StateCross::None`; focused,
  legacy-subvector, and inventory-pin tests pass.
- **F-M09-021-3 accepted resolved:** the evidence no longer mixes per-game and per-decision units;
  post-correction measurements retain their variance-rejected disposition.
- **F-M09-021-1 remains HIGH:** `held_secret_progress_for_choice(&Choice)` is not a typed private
  capability because `Choice` is public and freely constructible. A caller with public `Observed`
  can construct an opponent-owned choice and retrieve that opponent's secret aliases/progress. The
  rewritten engine test positively demonstrates this cross-seat request through `seen_a` and
  `choice_b`; its later A-only assertion does not prevent it.
- Independent checks: engine accessor **1/0**; policy `StateCross::None` **1/0**;
  opponent-feature isolation **1/0**; legacy-subvector pin **1/0**; inventory pin **1/0**;
  `git diff --check` clean.
- **Status:** M09-021 remains open; M09-024 remains dependency-blocked. Next exact action is a
  genuine acting-seat/private-view boundary, a negative cross-seat test, affected gates, and a
  narrow independent Tier-C recheck.

## M09-021 F-M09-021-1 round 2 — typed private-view boundary (implementer, 2026-08-24)

- **Design:** `SeatObservation<'a>` in `ti4_engine::choice` — private fields, no public
  constructor; values exist only where engine ask paths bind them (`Table::ask_seeing` + window
  sibling), after the decider lookup by `choice.player`. Argumentless `held_secret_progress()` and
  `held_state()` answer for the bound seat only; deref to `Observed` keeps public-fact call sites.
- **Removed from public surface:** `Observed::held_secret_progress_for_choice` (round-1 fix) and —
  discovered during round 2, same hole class — `Observed::redacted_for(viewer)` (arbitrary viewer →
  that seat's unredacted secrets). No method on `Observed` now returns named private data with any
  caller-controlled identity argument.
- **Live path:** `Decider::choose_seeing(&SeatObservation<'_>)`; learned bot passes
  `seen.held_secret_progress()` explicitly into feature extraction (`consider` /
  `explicit_choice_features` / `explicit_option_features` take `held_secrets: &[CardProgress]`).
- **Offline path:** documented free function `ti4_engine::choice::held_secret_progress(state,
  content, sources, galaxy, viewer)`; every call site names its records. `ask_private(choice, seen,
  decider)` is the public test/offline seam (binds internally, shared validation).
- **Tests:** new engine boundary tests (two bound views from one public Observed — own cards only,
  records and full-state form with marker assertions; offline-seam binding through validation);
  two redaction tests rewritten against `held_state()`; policy-level cross-seat isolation test kept.
- **Gates:** workspace **1367/0** (net +1 new engine test); clippy introduces no new warnings in any
  touched file (pre-existing: game.rs:1260, strategy.rs:589, ti4-training example pedantic set,
  seat_advantage unused import from b3895d2); rustfmt clean on all touched files; pre-existing fmt
  drift in action_cards/exploration/strategy left untouched.
- **Writable paths used:** original declarations (choice.rs, features.rs) + declared extensions
  (bot.rs, inference.rs, faction_abilities.rs, profile.rs, nine training examples) + round-2
  addendum (redaction boundary: choice.rs + three of those same examples; `bound_seat` rename; two-line
  dangling-doc cleanup in choice.rs). All declared before or contemporaneously with edits as recorded
  in the ledger.
- **Status:** correction complete on `wp/m09-021-objective-policy-features`; pending fresh
  independent Tier-C recheck of this commit (confirming both the capability boundary and the
  redaction-boundary extension). M09-021 remains open; M09-024 remains dependency-blocked.

## M09-021 fresh independent Tier-C recheck of `11cb060` (2026-08-24) — changes required

- Accepted: private `SeatObservation` fields/construction, argumentless private-data accessors,
  authenticated live `Table::ask_seeing` binding, removal of `Observed::redacted_for(viewer)`, and
  explicit full-state offline feature inputs. F-M09-021-2/3 remain resolved.
- **F-M09-021-1 remains HIGH:** public `ask_private(choice, seen, decider)` mints a
  `SeatObservation` from freely constructible `choice.player`. Code holding a legitimate bound
  view can deref to public `Observed`, forge an opponent choice, supply its own decider, and receive
  the opponent-bound capability, exposing both `held_secret_progress()` and `held_state()`.
- The focused `ask_private` test demonstrates this primitive; the function bypasses the per-seat
  decider lookup that authenticates the safe live table path and does not require full-state access.
- Independent gates: engine bound-progress **1/0**; engine `ask_private` **1/0**; policy opponent
  isolation **1/0**; policy `StateCross::None` **1/0**; scoped Clippy has no new package warning;
  `git diff --check` clean.
- **Status:** M09-021 and M09-024 remain blocked. Next action is to remove or authority-gate public
  `ask_private`, add a forged-seat/recursive negative regression, rerun affected gates, and request
  another narrow independent Tier-C recheck.

## M09-021 F-M09-021-1 round 3 — authority-gated `ask_private` (implementer, 2026-08-24)

- **Recheck of `11cb060`: changes required.** Accepted: private `SeatObservation`, argumentless
  accessors, authenticated live `Table::ask_seeing` binding, removal of `redacted_for(viewer)`.
  F-M09-021-1 remained HIGH: public `ask_private(choice, seen, decider)` minted a capability from
  the caller-controlled `choice.player`, and the caller-supplied decider received it — code with
  only bound/public assets could forge an opponent choice and read that seat's secrets.
- **Correction (reviewer option 2):** `ask_private` now takes `(choice, &GameState, &ContentStore,
  SourceSet, Option<&Galaxy>, decider)` and constructs the observation internally. A live policy
  caller holds no state handle (all observation fields private), so the mint is inexpressible with
  bound/public assets; offline contexts holding full state may bind any owner — hidden information
  does not exist there (same model as `held_secret_progress(...)`).
- **Call sites:** all 23 updated to pass full fixture state explicitly (engine ×2, bot tests ×15,
  inference tests ×6); dead `watched` helper removed; four unused `seen` locals dropped.
- **New regression:** `a_bound_view_cannot_mint_an_opponent_capability` — attacker assets exactly
  {bound view for a, deref'd public Observed, forged opponent choice}; every reachable call returns
  no data about b; the only minting entry point requires `&GameState`, which the test does not hold.
- **Gates:** workspace **1368/0** (engine 855/0 incl. new regression); scoped clippy shows only the
  two documented pre-existing engine warnings (`game.rs:1260`, `strategy.rs:589`); rustfmt clean on
  all touched files; `git diff --check` clean. Exact outputs in `plans/evidence/M09-021.md`.
- **Status:** round-3 correction complete on `wp/m09-021-objective-policy-features`; pending narrow
  independent Tier-C recheck of the resulting commit. M09-021 and M09-024 remain blocked until
  acceptance.

## M09-021 F-M09-021-1 round 4 — remove the state source from the capability (implementer, 2026-08-25)

- **Recheck of `aed3304`: changes required.** Z1 (HIGH): `held_state()` returned an owned
  `GameState`, so the bound view was itself a state handle — a decider could mint any seat's
  capability through `ask_private` one method call away (reviewer measured: minted seat "b").
  Z2 (HIGH): even that copy's redaction is defeated by set complement (`secret_deck` unredacted;
  deck + dealt == 40) — catalogue − deck named every opponent's secret, 5/5 exact. Z3 (MEDIUM):
  the round-3 regression asserted "inexpressible" while its own step 2 called `held_state()`.
  Reviewer scope note accepted: mechanism pre-dates M09-021; the closure claim was what was wrong.
- **Correction (reviewer option 1):** `SeatObservation::held_state()` removed — no method on
  `SeatObservation` or `Observed` now produces a `GameState` or deck data. Free function
  `redacted_full_state(state, viewer)` beside `held_secret_progress(...)` serves the five engine
  redaction tests (they hold fixture state). New bound-seat accessor `held_secrets()` (no args) and
  face-up `Observed` accessors (`promissory_notes()`, `support_holders()`; strategic tokens were
  already on PublicSeat). All three offline examples reworked off the state copy.
- **Regression rewritten as an active attack attempt** (Z3): attacker decider tries every reachable
  read and records anything naming b's actual card — asserted empty; complement computation
  executed from the table side recovers exactly the two dealt cards (non-vacuous), proving the
  danger is real and unreachable through bound assets.
- **Gates:** workspace **1368/0**; ti4-engine clippy shows only the two documented pre-existing
  warnings; no new warning in any touched file (example drift hunk-verified against HEAD); choice.rs
  rustfmt-clean (examples carry only their pre-existing drift, same hunks as at HEAD); `git diff
  --check` clean. Exact outputs in `plans/evidence/M09-021.md`.
- **Status:** round-4 correction complete on `wp/m09-021-objective-policy-features`; pending narrow
  independent Tier-C recheck of the resulting commit. M09-021 and M09-024 remain blocked until
  acceptance.

## M09-021 F-M09-021-1 round 4 — AA1 correction (implementer, 2026-08-25)

- **Round-4 recheck: F-M09-021-1 resolved; one required fix before close.** AA1 (MEDIUM):
  `Observed::promissory_notes()` returned the whole note-position map under a doc comment claiming
  "Public: notes sit faceup on the table (LRR 69.3)" — but LRR 69.3 is exactly what distinguishes
  the two cases, and the engine already implements it (`GameState::promissory_faceup`). Measured:
  25 of 34 corpus note records are in-hand (`playArea = false`), including `ms`. Round 4 had
  converted an unredacted-copy leak into a declared public API with a docstring the corpus
  contradicts. Reviewer's required fix applied as specified.
- **Fix:** (1) `promissory_notes()` now returns only the faceup subset — filtered by
  `state.promissory_faceup`; owned `BTreeMap` return; doc comment corrected. (2) `military_support.rs`
  moved onto the explicit-records model: main builds each game (the rollout's PythonPool setup path),
  drives it step by step, and reads the note position from full state at visible cost — one named
  read per decision in `drive()`, gated on `StepResult.resolved_choice` so sampling moments are
  exactly the old watch's decider-ask moments (secondary windows included). Policy side: plain
  `LearnedBot`s, nothing private reaches a decider. Output format unchanged; verified identical on a
  2-seed × 6-rotation run before/after the rework.
- **New focused test** `promissory_notes_expose_only_the_faceup_subset` pins the projection against
  the engine's own receipt path (`promissory::take`: play-area note → public, in-hand note → absent).
- **Gates:** workspace **1369/0**; ti4-engine clippy at its two documented pre-existing warnings;
  example warning-free under `--example military_support`; choice.rs and the example rustfmt-clean;
  `git diff --check` clean. Exact outputs in `plans/evidence/M09-021.md`.
- **Status:** AA1 correction complete on `wp/m09-021-objective-policy-features`; pending narrow
  independent Tier-C recheck of the resulting commit. M09-021 and M09-024 remain blocked until
  acceptance.

## M09-021 CLOSED — objective policy features (operator attestation, 2026-08-25)

- **Acceptance:** the operator reports the independent Tier-C recheck of `4bf8e9f` is done and
  passed. No written recheck verdict for that commit exists in this repository; recorded as an
  operator decision rather than a reviewer acceptance (M09-019b precedent). Final verification on
  the committed tree: workspace **1369/0**.
- **Findings disposition:** F-M09-021-1 RESOLVED and CLOSED after four correction rounds + AA1
  (typed `SeatObservation` boundary; authority-gated `ask_private`; state source removed from the
  capability; faceup-only `promissory_notes()`). F-M09-021-2 (dual-namespace emission) and
  F-M09-021-3 (dimensionally invalid performance claim) resolved in round 1. Full trail:
  `plans/M09-021_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`, `plans/evidence/M09-021.md`.
- **Branch:** `wp/m09-021-objective-policy-features` @ `4bf8e9f` (chain: initial → F2/F3 round 1 →
  typed boundary round 2 → authority-gated seam round 3 → state-source removal round 4 → AA1).
- **Next dependency-ready packages:** **M09-022** (ability decomposition policy features; deps
  M08-019 ✓, M09-018 ✓) and **M09-023** (secret redaction in feature paths; same deps). M09-025 is
  also ready (deps row 019 ✓). M09-024 remains blocked on rows 022–023. In milestone row order the
  next package to start is **M09-022**.

## M09-021 AA1 — written independent recheck recorded (Claude Opus 5, 2026-08-25)

- The close at `dc1fe49` rested on an operator attestation because no written verdict for
  `4bf8e9f` existed. That verdict now exists in `plans/M09-021_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`, and it
  **accepts** the AA1 correction, so the closure rests on a recorded review rather than a verbal
  report. No change to the disposition.
- **Independently re-verified on the committed tree:** workspace **1369/0**; `cargo clippy -p
  ti4-engine --all-targets` shows exactly the two documented pre-existing warnings
  (`game.rs:1260`, `strategy.rs:589`); the faceup filter is the only path to note positions and
  `PublicSeat` carries counts only.
- **Equivalence claim re-measured at 15× the recorded scale.** The `military_support.rs` rework
  changed both the setup path and the sampling moments; the implementer's check observed one
  departure across 12 games. Both versions were run at 30 seeds × 6 rotations, 4 rounds — the
  pre-rework example built in a throwaway worktree at `1700824` so it ran against its own engine:
  **62 departures, 34.4% of games, identical per-faction holder breakdown, identical token-drop
  count, byte-identical output**. Both changes confirmed inert at 62 events.

## M09-022 implemented — ability decomposition policy features (2026-08-25)

- **Author:** Claude Opus 5, who reviewed M08-017 through M09-021 and is therefore **not eligible
  to review this package**. The independent-review seat for M09-022 onward is open; the package is
  not done until that review is resolved.
- **Branch:** `wp/m09-022-ability-decomposition-features` from `dc1fe49`. Spec:
  `plans/M09-022_ABILITY_DECOMPOSITION_FEATURES.md`. Evidence: `plans/evidence/M09-022.md`.
- **Delivered:** six faction-decomposition families (`ability:`, `faction-start-tech:`,
  `faction-tech:`, `faction-start-unit:`, `faction-home:`, `faction-commodities`) for the acting
  seat, emitted in the two disjoint namespaces F-M09-021-2 settled — bare on every option under
  every crossing mode including `StateCross::None`, crossed copies for linear delivery. Computed
  once per choice in `ChoiceContext`. `EXPLICIT_FIXED_FAMILIES` extended 27 → 33.
- **Two reconciliations against MLP §5.3, recorded rather than absorbed:** the plan says 33
  playable seats and the corpus holds **34 faction records** — the extra is `neutral`, the
  Thunder's Edge units-only record (empty `homeSystem`/`startingFleet`/`homePlanets`, no abilities,
  none of the playable-seat fields). Excluded by a **corpus predicate** (`is_selectable_seat`,
  non-empty home system), not by name, so a future non-seat record cannot slip through. §5.3's
  separation table otherwise reproduces exactly: 32/34 under abilities alone with the single
  Keleres collision, **34/34** once fleet/home planets/commodities are added.
- **Separation is measured on emitted features**, not on the builder: all **33 selectable seats**
  produce distinct decompositions, zero collisions.
- **Invariant kept:** the faction record resolves through `seen.content()`/`seen.sources()`, never
  `ContentStore::embedded()` and never a hardcoded scope — the M08-019 Y2 / M09-021 AA1 defect
  class. Guarded by `ability_facts_follow_the_active_source_scope` (`bastion` is in scope under
  DEFAULT, out of scope under POK, so a hardcoded scope of either value fails one assertion).
- **Gates:** `ti4-policy --lib` **132/0** (126 before); workspace **1375/0** (1369 before), re-run
  after formatting; clippy clean in `ti4-policy`; rustfmt clean with all 56 changed lines confined
  to code this package added (no pre-existing drift absorbed — the O-M09-021-2 trap);
  `git diff --check` clean. Both pins pass with no legacy value moved.
- **Open items:** O-M09-022-1 (LOW) — the *store* half of the active-domain invariant is argued
  from the call, not proven by a second `from_dir` store; that is the standard of evidence M08-019
  Y1 showed to be insufficient, so it is recorded as open rather than claimed. O-M09-022-2 (INFO) —
  per-choice fleet parsing is unmeasured.
- **Status:** implementation complete, gates green, **pending independent review**. M09-023 does
  not depend on this package and may start in parallel; M09-024 stays blocked on rows 022–023.

## Carried finding — authored bot resolves content through the wrong domain and scope (2026-08-25)

Found while verifying the M08-019 corrections; **not** part of M09-022 and not yet scheduled.

`ScoredBot::new` (`crates/ti4-policy/src/bot.rs:64`) sets `content: ContentStore::embedded()` and
`sources: POK`. `Seats::Scored` (`crates/ti4-sim/src/run.rs:63`) seats it without
`.with_sources()`, so every authored-bot seat values the position at **POK while the game is
played at DEFAULT = FULL**. `content_types.rs` states the rule directly: "Runtime paths — the
simulator, the training rollout, evaluation — use this [DEFAULT]. A test may still scope to BASE or
POK deliberately when it is *about* scoping; anything else should read this constant rather than
picking a set of its own."

Measured: **354 Thunder's Edge-only records** are invisible to the bot — 21 units, 13 technologies,
49 planets, 36 systems, 8 tokens, 20 leaders, 7 relics, 6 promissory notes, 2 strategy cards.

Two consequences, one live and one about instruments:

1. The authored bot systematically mis-values TE content in TE games, and the M08-021 v1/v2/v3
   behavioral baselines were generated with that bot.
2. Reading the store from `embedded()` makes the bot invisible to any `from_dir` corpus
   perturbation — the same blindness mechanism M08-019 Y1 identified in `annexable()`. The E1
   28-category × 30-seed matrix that certified M08 therefore could not have detected an order or
   content dependence inside the bot's own valuation path. Its 0/28 result is sound for the engine
   and vacuous for the bot.

**Unmeasured:** whether correcting the scope changes play. The probe (flip `ScoredBot::new` to
DEFAULT, replay the 30-seed behavioral batch, compare) was set up but not run. Until it is, no
claim is made either way about whether the recorded bounds move.

## M09-023 implemented — secret redaction in feature paths (2026-08-25)

- **Author:** Claude Opus 5, ineligible to review it. Tier **C** (hidden information) requires a
  frontier review; that seat is open. Spec: `plans/M09-023_SECRET_REDACTION_IN_FEATURE_PATHS.md`.
  Evidence: `plans/evidence/M09-023.md`.
- **§5.2's prescribed mechanism no longer exists, and that is the right outcome.** The plan says to
  build features from `Observed::redacted_for(player)`. That method was removed in M09-021
  F-M09-021-1 round 2 as a defect in its own right, and its successor `held_state()` at round 4.
  What replaced them is stronger than what §5.2 asked for: `Observed` carries no private data of
  any seat, so there is no view to redact. This package delivers §5.2's **requirement**, not its
  **mechanism**, and records the divergence rather than reinterpreting the plan.
- **What was actually outstanding** was the emission. `opponent-secrets-held:<n>` was specified in
  §5.2 and had never been built — there were no opponent facts of any kind in the feature paths.
- **Delivered:** `opponent-secrets-held:<n>` = the number of opponents holding exactly n secrets.
  The count keys the name, the value counts the seats, so no opponent is named — a per-seat
  feature would be a board identity meaningless next game. Read entirely from `PublicSeat`, which
  carries counts and no card identity. Emitted bare on every option under every crossing mode plus
  crossed copies, per F-M09-021-2. `EXPLICIT_FIXED_FAMILIES` 33 → 34. Explicit path only: the
  legacy hashed extractor's bucket inputs stay frozen.
- **Proof across every feature set, not one:** for each of three seats holding 2 / 1 / 0 known
  secrets, both the explicit path and the legacy hashed name path are extracted and no opponent
  alias appears in either. The anonymity test carries a **sensitivity** half — swapping which
  opponent holds which count leaves the facts identical, changing the distribution changes them —
  because anonymity alone is satisfied by a constant (the X1 lesson from M08-021).
- **A wrong assertion, recorded rather than quietly fixed.** The first non-vacuity check asserted
  that the acting seat's own secret alias appears in its features, and failed: an alias reaches the
  features only once the secret is *satisfied*; before that it contributes family-token progress.
  The fix was to strengthen rather than weaken — remove the acting seat's records and show the
  feature set changes.
- **Gates:** `ti4-policy --lib` **135/0** (132 after M09-022); workspace **1378/0** (1375 after
  M09-022); clippy clean in `ti4-policy`; rustfmt clean with changed lines confined to code this
  package added; `git diff --check` clean. Both pins pass with no legacy value moved.
- **Open items:** O-M09-023-1 (LOW) alias-absence measured on one fixture position and one choice
  kind; O-M09-023-2 (INFO) emitting `opponent-secrets-held:0` is a judgement the plan does not
  settle; O-M09-023-3 (INFO) per-choice cost unmeasured.
- **Status:** implementation complete, gates green, pending independent Tier-C review. With rows
  019–023 landed, **M09-024** (dense vocabulary, OOV registry and capacity) becomes
  dependency-ready. **M09-025** (CPU libtorch/tch adapter) has been ready since row 019.

## M09-022 / M09-023 independent reviews (2026-08-25)

- **M09-022 (`26ad269`) — changes required.** F-M09-022-1 MEDIUM: the package specification and
  definition of done require an alternate `ContentStore::from_dir` regression proving emitted
  decomposition follows the active store. Only the source-scope half is tested; code inspection of
  `seen.content()` is not the required regression evidence. Other decomposition/separation and pin
  checks pass. Ledger: `plans/M09-022_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`.
- **M09-023 (`662e27c`) — Tier-C accepted for its delta.** Opponent facts read only public counts,
  are seat-anonymous and distribution-sensitive, survive `StateCross::None`, and leave the legacy
  extractor unchanged. All three observations are non-blocking/deferred as recorded in
  `plans/M09-023_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`.
- Independent gates on combined HEAD: focused M09-022 and M09-023 tests green; legacy/inventory
  pins green; `ti4-policy --lib` **135/0**; scoped Clippy has no policy warning; rustfmt and
  `git diff --check` clean.
- **Status correction:** rows 019–023 are not all complete. M09-022 remains open, so the stacked
  M09-023 branch cannot integrate and **M09-024 remains dependency-blocked**. M09-025 remains ready.
- **Next exact action:** implement the bounded alternate-store regression for M09-022, rerun its
  focused/policy/workspace gates, update evidence, and request a narrow Tier-B plus overlap recheck.

## M09-022 correction accepted at `b444f52` (2026-08-25)

- **F-M09-022-1 resolved and closed:** the required alternate-store regression loads a valid
  modified corpus through `ContentStore::from_dir`, proves emitted decomposition follows the active
  store in both directions, and includes non-degeneracy plus recorded mutant-failure evidence.
- Independent narrow gates: active-store **1/0**; source-scope **1/0**; M09-023 overlap **3/0**;
  legacy-subvector and inventory pins **1/0** each; scoped Clippy introduces no policy warning;
  rustfmt/diff-check clean; temporary fixture directories remaining **0**.
- **M09-022 is Tier-B accepted. M09-023's Tier-C acceptance remains valid on the combined
  frontier. Rows M09-019 through M09-023 are complete, so M09-024 is dependency-ready.** M09-025
  also remains ready.

## MEASURED — the authored bot plays at the wrong source scope, and it changes the game (2026-08-25)

Follow-up to the finding carried forward in `1d50213`. It was recorded there as unmeasured. It is
now measured, and it is not latent.

### The defect

`ScoredBot::new` (`crates/ti4-policy/src/bot.rs:64`) sets `sources: POK`. `Seats::Scored`
(`crates/ti4-sim/src/run.rs:63`) seats it without `.with_sources()`, so **every authored-bot seat
values the position at POK while the game is played at DEFAULT = FULL**. `content_types.rs` states
the rule the code breaks, in the doc comment on `DEFAULT` itself:

> Runtime paths — the simulator, the training rollout, evaluation — use this. A test may still
> scope to `BASE` or `POK` deliberately when it is *about* scoping; anything else should read this
> constant rather than picking a set of its own.

FULL = POK + Thunder's Edge. Measured: **354 TE-only records** are invisible to the bot's valuation
— 21 units, 13 technologies, 49 planets, 36 systems, 8 tokens, 20 leaders, 7 relics, 6 promissory
notes, 2 strategy cards. The bot filters them out of every `in_sources(self.sources)` check and
fails every `unit_value` lookup against them, in games that contain them.

### The measurement

Probe: `ScoredBot::new`'s `sources` changed `POK` → `DEFAULT`, nothing else; the M08-021 behavioral
suite (`play_batch`, all 30 seeds, `Seats::Scored`) run before and after; mutation reverted and
`bot.rs` verified byte-identical to HEAD afterwards.

| metric | recorded v3 bound | POK (as committed) | DEFAULT (corrected) | in bound? |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| `completion` | 1.0–1.0 | 1.000000000 | 1.000000000 | inside |

Total VP across the 30-seed × 6-seat set: **674 → 746**, mean VP/seat **3.744 → 4.144 (+10.7%)**.
`faction_differentiation` moves **+51.5%**.

**Six of the ten gated metrics land outside the recorded v3 bounds.** The behavioral gate would
fail on the corrected bot — which is the correct outcome, because the bounds were recorded from a
bot playing at the wrong scope. They are bounds on a mis-scoped agent.

### What this means, stated plainly

1. The M08-021 v1/v2/v3 behavioral baselines describe an authored bot that cannot see Thunder's
   Edge content in games that contain it. Every downstream citation of those bounds inherits that.
2. Correcting the scope is a **re-baseline event**, and by the M07-020/M08-019 precedent an
   operator decision — it invalidates a recorded baseline and moves a gate.
3. The direction is not neutral. The corrected bot scores materially more, so the mis-scoped
   baseline understates what the authored bot can do — which is the arm the MLP branch is measured
   against.

### The second half — the instrument

`ScoredBot::new` also sets `content: ContentStore::embedded()`, ignoring whichever store the game
runs on. That makes the bot **invisible to any `ContentStore::from_dir` perturbation**, which is
the same blindness mechanism M08-019 Y1 identified in `annexable()`.

Consequence for the M08 exit gate: the E1 campaign (28 content categories × 30 seeds, reported
`0/28`) was run with `Seats::Scored`. It could not have detected an order or content dependence
inside the bot's own valuation path, because that path never reads the perturbed store. **The 0/28
result is sound for the engine and vacuous for the bot.** No claim is made here that such a
dependence exists — only that the instrument could not have seen one.

### Not yet decided

This is a finding with a measurement, not a package. It needs an operator decision before any code
moves, because the fix changes recorded gate values. The options, and what each costs, are for the
operator; recorded here so the decision is made against numbers rather than against an argument.

## Operator decisions (2026-08-25)

Both taken against the measurements immediately above, not against arguments.

### D-2026-08-25-1 — the authored-bot scope defect is deferred until after M09

**Decision: defer entirely until after M09.** No code moves; the finding and its measurement stand
recorded. `ScoredBot` continues to value positions at POK in games played at DEFAULT = FULL, and
the M08-021 v3 bounds continue to describe that bot.

What the deferral carries, so it is not rediscovered as a surprise:

- The MLP branch's authored arm is mis-scoped. Every comparison of a learned policy against
  `Seats::Scored` is a comparison against an agent that cannot see 354 Thunder's Edge records,
  including 21 units and 13 technologies. Measured, the correction is worth **+10.7% mean VP/seat**
  to the authored arm, so the current baseline **understates** it.
- The M08-021 bounds are bounds on that agent. They are not wrong as a regression tripwire — they
  will still catch a change in the bot — but they are not a description of a correctly-scoped bot,
  and nothing downstream should be read as one.
- The M08-019 E1 perturbation campaign (`0/28`) remains sound for the engine and vacuous for the
  bot, since `ScoredBot` reads `ContentStore::embedded()` and never sees a perturbed store.
- When it is eventually corrected, it is a **re-baseline event**: six of ten gated metrics land
  outside the v3 bounds, so the behavioral gate fails until v4 is derived through the versioned
  process.

**Revisit after M09-030.** Doing it before M10-031's teacher-corpus capture would be cheaper than
after, since the corpus is generated by these bots — worth weighing when the deferral is revisited.

### D-2026-08-25-2 — M09-025 is not authorized yet; wait for the M09-022 recheck

**Decision: hold M09-025.** No P2 scoped access is granted, no `tch` pin is added, and no libtorch
distribution is downloaded. The next package is **M09-024** (dense vocabulary, OOV registry and
capacity), to begin once the narrow independent Tier-B recheck of `b444f52` lands and M09-022
closes.

M09-025 remains dependency-ready on row 019 and can be authorized at any point; it gates all
`tch`-based model work (M09-026 onward), so it is on the critical path even though it is not
blocking today.

### Current state

- **M09-021** closed. **M09-023** accepted for its delta.
- **M09-022** open, awaiting the narrow Tier-B recheck of `b444f52` (F-M09-022-1 corrected: the
  alternate-store regression now exists and was proved to fail without the property).
- **M09-024** blocked on that recheck. **M09-025** held by decision. Rows 026–030 follow 024/025.

## M09-022 accepted, M09-024 split, M09-024a implemented (2026-08-25)

- **M09-022 accepted** at the narrow Tier-B recheck of `b444f52`; F-M09-022-1 closed. The recheck
  confirmed the mutation check falsifies the embedded-store defect while leaving the source-scope
  test green, so both tests are necessary. M09-024 dependency-ready.
- **M09-024 split, declared before implementation** per the plan's instruction for oversized rows.
  `plans/M09-024_DENSE_VOCABULARY_AND_OOV_CAPACITY.md` records it: **M09-024a** (P1) is the
  vocabulary itself; **M09-024b** (P2) is the corpus — the r6 names, the §6.1 teacher-schedule
  replay, and the statically enumerable content names. The parent acceptance criterion is unchanged
  and is met only when both land. "Build the vocabulary" and "discover the names to build it from"
  are not one behavior cluster, and together they cannot be reviewed from a single diff.
- **M09-024a implemented.** New `crates/ti4-policy/src/vocabulary.rs`: reserved OOV registry
  (global column 0, then one per registered family, order fixed by `OOV_REGISTRY_VERSION`),
  assignment by ascending `FeatureKey`, hard collision refusal, `slot_count` vs `capacity` (next
  multiple of 4,096 at or above 1.2×, refused above 65,536), append-only growth that is key-ordered
  within the batch and refuses rather than reshaping, and a validating `slots.json` round trip.
- **Measured:** the r6 champion profile holds **41,113** distinct names — §4.5's own figure,
  recomputed independently as the union across the six champions (hacan 37,109, jolnar 38,189,
  l1z1x 38,605, letnev 37,267, sol 38,925, xxcha 36,351) and matching exactly. **39** reserved
  columns (38 families + global). `V_cap` for the r6 corpus alone: **53,248**, under the 65,536
  limit, so no architecture review is triggered. The figure grows when 024b folds in the replayed
  and content names; it is recorded now so that growth is visible rather than asserted.
- **Gates:** vocabulary focused **12/0**; workspace **1391/0** (1379 before); clippy clean in
  `ti4-policy`; rustfmt clean; `git diff --check` clean.
- **Open items:** O-M09-024a-1 (LOW) the build-time collision branch is covered by inspection only
  — a real 64-bit FNV-1a collision cannot be constructed in a test, so the branch is reached
  through the loader rather than by adding a test-only seam. O-M09-024a-2/3/4 (INFO): provisional
  `V_cap`; free-row zeroing deferred to the tensor packages, where the tensor exists; and the
  shared `*-unit` OOV column as a design call the plan does not make.
- **Status:** pending independent Tier-C review (schema — the column layout is a migration
  boundary). M09-024b follows on acceptance and needs a P2 scoped-access declaration first.

## M09-024a independent Tier-C review of `c3d5514` (2026-08-25) — changes required

- **F-M09-024a-1 HIGH:** `OOV_REGISTRY_VERSION = 1` does not pin the reserved layout. The order is
  dynamically rebuilt and sorted from current family lists, so adding a family can move existing
  OOV columns without changing the version; the coverage test does not catch this migration.
- **F-M09-024a-2 HIGH:** `from_json` validates only key/name agreement, duplicate keys, and
  assigned rows fitting capacity. It accepts unsupported versions, arbitrary `oov_count`, a wrong
  or missing reserved prefix/global OOV, and invalid/over-limit capacity. Public mutable fields and
  unchecked public `reindex` also bypass the claimed invariant boundary.
- Independent gates: vocabulary **12/0**; full policy **148/0**; scoped Clippy/rustfmt and
  diff-check clean. Independently reproduced r6 counts exactly, union **41,113**.
- O-M09-024a-1 accepted LOW; O2 provisional to 024b; O3 deferred to tensor gates; O4 accepted.
  Ledger: `plans/M09-024a_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`.
- **Status:** M09-024a remains open and M09-024b remains blocked. Next action is a frozen
  version-1 registry, fail-closed stored-layout validation/private invariant surface, negative
  fixtures, affected gates, and a fresh Tier-C recheck.

## F-M09-024a-1 / F-M09-024a-2 correction (implementer, 2026-08-25)

Both findings are correct, and F1 is the more serious of the two. It is also the defect class this
chain has been finding in other people's work for five packages, written this time by me:
`OOV_REGISTRY_VERSION` was documented as freezing the reserved column order, and froze nothing.
The order was recomputed from the live grammars and sorted, so adding an ordinary feature family —
something M09-021, M09-022 and M09-023 each did — would insert into the sorted order and shift
every later reserved column while the version still read `1`. A claim stated one step stronger than
its construction supported, in the flattering direction.

### F-M09-024a-1 — the version-1 registry is now data

`OOV_FAMILIES_V1` is a written-out list of 38 families in their allocated order. `oov_families()`
returns it; nothing recomputes it. Adding a family is now a **migration decision** — bump the
version, write a new list — rather than a side effect of editing a grammar. Until that decision is
taken, a new family's unseen names route to the global column, which is the conservative direction.

`live_grammar_families()` is kept, but only for comparison; nothing addresses a column by it.

The forcing function is `the_frozen_registry_matches_the_live_grammar`, and its failure message
says what to do rather than leaving the next person to guess:

> the feature grammars and the frozen OOV registry disagree. Do not edit `OOV_FAMILIES_V1` in
> place: that moves reserved columns under a version that promises they never move. Bump
> `OOV_REGISTRY_VERSION` and add a new frozen list.

**Falsification check.** A frozen registry that cannot detect its own staleness would be no better
than the derived one. `OOV_FAMILIES_V1` was temporarily shortened by one family — exactly the
"grammar moved, registry did not" state — and the suite re-run:

```
test vocabulary::tests::the_frozen_registry_matches_the_live_grammar ... FAILED
    the feature grammars and the frozen OOV registry disagree. …
test result: FAILED. 17 passed; 1 failed
```

Reverted; 18/18 green on the reverted tree.

### F-M09-024a-2 — the stored layout is validated, and the type cannot be edited around

`validate` now checks, in order, before the key/name and duplicate checks it already did:

1. **Registry version** — an unrecognised version is refused outright (`UnsupportedRegistry`).
   Fail closed: the reserved columns below belong to a layout this build cannot identify.
2. **The reserved prefix, element by element** — `oov_count` equals the registry plus one, the
   global OOV is at column 0, and every reserved column holds exactly the family the registry puts
   there (`ReservedLayout`). Checked per element rather than by length, because the corruption that
   matters — two reserved columns swapped — preserves the count and silently re-points every
   trained OOV weight.
3. **Capacity** — `capacity` must be the value the sizing rule gives for the assigned count, which
   carries the 4,096 granularity and the 65,536 limit with it (`CapacityMismatch` /
   `OverCapacity`). It is not a free field.

`column_of`'s `unwrap_or(0)` is gone. The global column is `GLOBAL_OOV_COLUMN`, guaranteed at
construction and re-checked at load, so a lookup that falls all the way through lands somewhere
defined rather than aliasing column 0 to whatever happened to be there.

The four schema fields are now **private with read-only accessors**, and `reindex` is private. A
caller can no longer invalidate a vocabulary after load without going through an API that preserves
the invariants — and `reindex` in particular was a trap, since calling it on slots changed behind
the type's back produces a perfectly consistent index over an invalid layout.

### Tests — six added, eighteen total

| test | class |
|---|---|
| `the_frozen_registry_matches_the_live_grammar` | F1 forcing function (falsification-checked above) |
| `a_stored_file_from_an_unknown_registry_version_is_refused` | metadata |
| `a_reordered_reserved_prefix_is_refused_even_though_the_count_is_right` | layout, count-preserving |
| `a_missing_global_oov_column_is_refused` | layout |
| `a_wrong_reserved_count_is_refused` | metadata |
| `a_stored_capacity_that_the_rule_does_not_give_is_refused` | three cases: sub-granularity, above the limit, and merely wrong |

Each malformed-file test builds a valid vocabulary, corrupts exactly one property, and requires the
loader to refuse it — so a check that is quietly removed makes its test fail rather than pass.
`a_stored_capacity_...` asserts its fixture differs from the real value before corrupting it.

### Gates after the correction

### Dispositions

F-M09-024a-1 and F-M09-024a-2 resolved. The four open-item dispositions in the review are accepted
as written — O-M09-024a-1 stays LOW (the loader collision test plus the shared implementation is
adequate now that loader validation is corrected), O-2 provisional `V_cap` belongs to 024b, O-3
free-row zeroing remains a mandatory M09-026/M09-028 gate, O-4 the `*-unit` wildcard stands.

Requesting a fresh independent Tier-C recheck. M09-024a and M09-024b remain blocked until it lands.

## M09-024a independent Tier-C recheck of `0aa415f` (2026-08-25) — changes required

- **Resolved:** F-M09-024a-1. `OOV_FAMILIES_V1` now freezes the exact ordered registry and the
  live-grammar test forces an explicit versioned migration. The unsupported-version, exact
  reserved-prefix/global-OOV, and private invariant-surface portions of F-M09-024a-2 are resolved.
- **F-M09-024a-3 HIGH:** `validate` requires `capacity == capacity_for(slots.len())`, but append
  correctly preserves fixed physical capacity while increasing assigned slots. A valid vocabulary
  filled to its 4,096-row capacity is consequently rejected on reload because the sizing rule now
  returns 8,192. The existing boundary test never round-trips the filled vocabulary.
- **Independent checks:** focused vocabulary suite 18/0; scoped Clippy has only the documented
  pre-existing engine warning at `game.rs:1260`; `git diff --check` clean.
- **Status:** M09-024a remains open; M09-024b remains blocked. Correct fixed-capacity validation,
  add append-across-threshold serialize/load coverage preserving capacity and all columns, rerun
  gates, then request a fresh Tier-C recheck. Full ledger:
  `plans/M09-024a_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`.

## F-M09-024a-3 correction (implementer, 2026-08-25)

The finding is correct, and the defect was introduced by my own F2 correction. Hardening
`validate` to check capacity, I checked it against `slots.len()` — the count *now* — when capacity
is fixed at allocation and `append` deliberately consumes free rows without touching it. So the
moment a vocabulary is appended past the 1.2× threshold, its own serialized form stops loading. A
successful append could produce an unloadable checkpoint, which is worse than the unchecked field
I was replacing.

Worth naming why no test caught it: `appending_past_capacity_is_refused_rather_than_reshaping`
already filled capacity exactly, and `a_round_trip_through_json_preserves_every_column_and_its_
lookups` already round-tripped. Neither did both. The defect lived precisely in the gap between two
tests that each covered half of it.

### The fix — allocation provenance, not recomputation

A new persisted field, `allocated_for`, records the assigned-column count the capacity was
allocated for. It is set once at build and never changed by `append`. `validate` now checks:

- `capacity == capacity_for(allocated_for)` — so the 1.2× rule stays independently provable after
  the slot count has moved, and `capacity_for` still carries the 4,096 granularity and the 65,536
  ceiling with it. The reviewer offered a weaker option (granularity + ceiling + `slots.len() <=
  capacity`); provenance is taken instead because it keeps the sizing rule checkable rather than
  merely making a stored capacity plausible.
- `allocated_for <= slots.len()` — columns are appended and never removed, so provenance exceeding
  the columns present means a file has had columns dropped, and every column after the gap would
  be addressed wrongly. New error `AllocationProvenance`.
- `slots.len() <= capacity`, unchanged.

### Regressions — three added, twenty-one total

| test | what it pins |
|---|---|
| `an_appended_vocabulary_survives_a_round_trip_across_the_sizing_threshold` | append past the 1.2× point, serialize, reload; capacity, provenance, every existing and appended column, and every lookup unchanged |
| `a_vocabulary_appended_to_exactly_full_still_reloads` | the sharpest form: every free row consumed |
| `a_file_claiming_more_columns_were_allocated_than_exist_is_refused` | the provenance check in the one direction it is checkable |

The first asserts its fixture is genuinely past the threshold — `capacity_for(slot_count) !=
capacity` — before round-tripping, so it cannot pass by testing a vocabulary that never crossed it.

**Falsification check.** `validate` was temporarily reverted to the defective
`capacity_for(self.slots.len())` rule and the suite re-run:

```
test vocabulary::tests::an_appended_vocabulary_survives_a_round_trip_across_the_sizing_threshold ... FAILED
test vocabulary::tests::a_vocabulary_appended_to_exactly_full_still_reloads ... FAILED
test result: FAILED. 19 passed; 2 failed
```

Both new round-trip regressions fail on the defect and nothing else does, which is the property
that makes them regressions rather than decoration. Reverted; 21/21 green on the reverted tree.

### Gates after the correction

### Note on the JSON shape

`slots.json` gains one field. No vocabulary has been persisted anywhere yet — M09-024b produces
the first — so this is a schema change with no existing readers, taken now rather than after
artifacts exist.

Requesting another fresh independent Tier-C recheck. M09-024a and M09-024b remain blocked.

## M09-024a independent Tier-C acceptance of `1b1c0b0` (2026-08-25)

- **Verdict:** accept. F-M09-024a-4 is resolved: persisted provenance is structurally bounded
  before arithmetic, and `capacity_for` is total and overflow-safe for every `usize`.
- **Review closure:** F-M09-024a-1 through F-M09-024a-4 are closed with no new actionable findings.
  Existing O1 LOW/O2 transfer/O3 deferred tensor gate/O4 accepted dispositions remain recorded in
  `plans/M09-024a_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`.
- **Independent gates:** vocabulary 24/0; complete workspace 1,403/0; scoped Clippy has no
  package-owned warning and only the documented pre-existing engine warning at `game.rs:1260`;
  scoped rustfmt and `git diff --check` clean.
- **Status:** M09-024a is accepted. **Next ready package: M09-024b**, the bounded corpus discovery,
  final `slots.json`, measured `V_cap`, and manifest evidence specified by the parent split.

## M09-024b Tier-C architecture ruling (2026-08-25)

- The 245,760 all-family result is rejected as an MLP layout; the 65,536 hard load/migration
  ceiling remains unchanged.
- The MLP consumes one **schema-4 explicit** path through a feature-compressed projection. Families
  whose identity is an unbounded lexical cross or full-option-id/state cross are suppressed before
  vocabulary lookup (`prompt-bigram`, `prompt-option`, `state-option` today). `state-kind` remains.
- Required correction: the eight original seat facts currently have no bare delivery path.
  M09-024b1 must add a bounded bare family before removing `state-option`; excluded names may not
  aggregate into an OOV row. The registry change is versioned, never an edit to v1.
- **24,576 is the package review ceiling, not fixed `V_cap`.** Exact capacity remains derived by
  accepted `capacity_for(allocated_for)` and may be 16,384 after single-path filtering. At the
  ceiling: 6,291,456 width-256 input weights and approximately 6.48M plan-accounted parameters.
- §6.1 is now feature-compressed distillation: full teacher distributions remain KL targets, but
  student inputs use the transferable projection. Fixed validation gates decide adequacy.
- **Continuation split:** M09-024b1 (P1/Tier C projection, bare facts, registry and tests) is next
  ready; M09-024b2 (P2/Tier C corrected 768-game replay and final artifact) follows. M09-024 and
  M09-026 remain blocked.
- Full decision: `plans/M09-024b_ARCHITECTURE_EVALUATION_REQUEST.md`.

## M09-024a independent Tier-C recheck of `7eb0722` (2026-08-25) — changes required

- **Resolved:** F-M09-024a-3. Allocation provenance remains fixed across append; crossing the
  sizing threshold and filling capacity both serialize/reload without changing capacity or columns.
- **F-M09-024a-4 HIGH:** untrusted `allocated_for` reaches `capacity_for` before its
  `slots.len()` bound is checked. A temporary malformed-JSON regression using `usize::MAX`
  independently panicked at `vocabulary.rs:682` (`attempt to multiply with overflow`) instead of
  returning `LoadError::Invalid`; the temporary test was removed after reproduction.
- **Independent gates:** vocabulary 21/0; full `ti4-policy --lib` 157/0; scoped Clippy has only the
  documented pre-existing engine warning at `game.rs:1260`.
- **Status:** M09-024a remains open; M09-024b remains blocked. Check provenance structural bounds
  before arithmetic, make `capacity_for` total/overflow-safe for every `usize`, retain an extreme
  malformed-JSON no-unwind regression, rerun gates, and request a fresh Tier-C recheck. Full ledger:
  `plans/M09-024a_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`.

## F-M09-024a-4 correction (implementer, 2026-08-25)

Correct, and the review reproduced it before reporting it, which made it unarguable. `allocated_for`
arrives from the file like every other field, and `validate` handed it to `capacity_for` *before*
bounding it. On an absurd value the float sizing arithmetic saturated its cast and then overflowed
the rounding step, so a malformed `slots.json` unwound the loader instead of returning
`LoadError::Invalid`.

The shape of the mistake, since this is the second one in a row on the same function: I keep
treating `allocated_for` as a number this code chose. It is not. It is untrusted input to a schema
boundary, and the checks on it have to come before anything computes with it — which is exactly
what "fail closed" means and exactly what I wrote in the doc comment while not doing it.

### The fix — two independent halves

**Ordering.** The structural bound runs first: a vocabulary always holds at least its reserved
prefix and columns are only ever appended, so provenance lies in `oov_count ..= slots.len()`.
Anything outside that is a malformed file, not a large number, and is refused before any
arithmetic sees it.

**Totality.** `capacity_for` is now total over every `usize`. The headroom is held as the exact
ratio `6/5` rather than `1.2_f64`, and the arithmetic is saturating with a checked rounding step,
so every input yields either a capacity within the limit or a structured `OverCapacity`. 1.2 is
exactly 6/5, so nothing is given up by leaving floats out; the three pinned values (4,096 at one
slot, 8,192 at an exact 4,096, 53,248 for the r6 corpus) are unchanged.

Both halves are kept even though either alone stops the panic, because they answer different
questions: the ordering says what a valid file may claim, and the totality says the function may
be called with anything at all.

### Regressions — three added, twenty-four total

| test | what it pins |
|---|---|
| `an_extreme_allocation_provenance_is_refused_without_unwinding` | `usize::MAX`, `usize::MAX / 2`, `4 × CAPACITY_LIMIT` all return `AllocationProvenance` |
| `a_provenance_below_the_reserved_prefix_is_refused` | the other end of the range |
| `the_sizing_rule_is_total_over_every_input` | nine inputs from 0 to `usize::MAX`: each yields a capacity within the limit and on the granularity, or a structured refusal — never an unwind. Also re-pins the three known values against the integer form. |

**Falsification check, one mutation per half.**

Restoring the float sizing rule:

```
test vocabulary::tests::the_sizing_rule_is_total_over_every_input ... FAILED
    attempt to multiply with overflow
test result: FAILED. 23 passed; 1 failed
```

Restoring the original check ordering (with the safe arithmetic kept):

```
test vocabulary::tests::an_extreme_allocation_provenance_is_refused_without_unwinding ... FAILED
    wrong error for provenance 18446744073709551615: … vocabulary needs capacity
    3689348814741913600, above the 65536 limit
test result: FAILED. 23 passed; 1 failed
```

Each half is caught by exactly one test, and by a different one. Both reverted; 24/24 green.

Requesting another fresh independent Tier-C recheck. M09-024a and M09-024b remain blocked.

## M09-024a ACCEPTED; M09-024b specified and awaiting P2 authorization (2026-08-25)

- **M09-024a accepted** at the Tier-C acceptance of `1b1c0b0`. F-M09-024a-1 through -4 all closed
  across four correction rounds: the frozen v1 registry, the hardened stored-layout validator,
  capacity validated against allocation provenance rather than the current slot count, and that
  provenance bounded before it reaches the arithmetic. Open-item dispositions stand (O-1 accepted
  LOW residual, O-2 final `V_cap` transfers to 024b, O-3 free-row zeroing remains a mandatory
  M09-026/M09-028 gate, O-4 accepted).
- **M09-024b specified**: `plans/M09-024b_VOCABULARY_CORPUS_AND_REPLAY.md`, including its full P2
  scoped-access declaration — reads two artifacts already on disk, 768 games, one written artifact
  (`out/vocabulary/slots.json`) capped at 16 MiB, no network, no dependencies, names only.
- **Not started.** The package is P2 and has not been authorized. Nothing in it has been run.

## M09-024b RAN AND STOPPED — vocabulary overruns the architecture limit (2026-08-25)

- **P2 authorized as declared** by the operator; the pass ran within every declared bound and
  **wrote no artifact**. `out/vocabulary/` does not exist.
- **Result: `V_cap` required 245,760 against the 65,536 limit — 3.75x over.** MLP plan section 4.5
  requires the package to stop for an explicit architecture review rather than allocate a larger
  model, and it did. This is the packages declared purpose, not a defect in it; what did not
  survive contact with the completed extractors is the plans own estimate.
- **Sources:** (a) r6 champions 41,113 names / 9,573 unique; (c) content 295 / 187; (b) the 768-game
  section 6.1 replay 194,083 / 162,435. Union 203,843. Every source contributes something no other
  does, so none is silently empty.
- **Growth:** r6 only 41,152 slots / 53,248 V_cap, reproducing M09-024a exactly; + content 41,447 /
  53,248; + replay STOPPED. The replay multiplies the vocabulary by 4.9x.
- **Where it comes from — the number the review needs.** Three families are **91.3
## M09-024b RAN AND STOPPED — the vocabulary overruns the architecture limit (2026-08-25)

- **P2 authorized as declared** by the operator. The pass ran within every declared bound and
  **wrote no artifact**: `out/vocabulary/` does not exist.
- **Result: `V_cap` required 245,760 against the 65,536 limit — 3.75× over.** MLP plan §4.5
  requires the package to stop for an explicit architecture review rather than silently allocate a
  larger model, and it did. This is the package's declared purpose, not a defect in it; what did
  not survive contact with the completed extractors is the plan's own estimate, drawn from the r6
  profile's 41,113 names.
- **Sources:** (a) r6 champions 41,113 names / 9,573 unique; (c) content records 295 / 187;
  (b) the 768-game §6.1 replay 194,083 / 162,435. Union **203,843**. Every source contributes
  something no other does, so none is silently empty — the check the package exists to make.
- **Growth:** r6 only → 41,152 slots / 53,248 `V_cap`, reproducing M09-024a exactly; + content →
  41,447 / 53,248; + replay → **STOPPED**. The replay multiplies the vocabulary by 4.9×.
- **Where it comes from — the number the review needs.** Three families are **91.3%** of the union:
  `state-option` 88,909 (43.6%), `prompt-option` 58,637 (28.8%), `prompt-bigram` 38,542 (18.9%).
  All three are keyed by option identity or prompt text rather than by anything the corpus bounds.
  `state-option` is the crossed namespace M09-021 kept for **linear** schema delivery — the
  nonlinear trunk reads the bare names; `prompt-option` and `prompt-bigram` are legacy
  hashed-extractor families. The objective, decomposition and opponent families this branch spent
  four packages adding are **0.3% combined**.
- **By exclusion:** without all three, 17,794 slots and `V_cap` 24,576 — comfortably inside the
  limit. Without only some of them, still over. So the decision is narrow: which of those three
  families get dense columns in the MLP input.
- **Gates:** `vocabulary_corpus` 3/0; workspace **1406/0** (1403 before); clippy clean in both new
  files; rustfmt clean; `git diff --check` clean.
- **Blocked on O-M09-024b-1**, an architecture decision and not mine to take. O-2: no frequency
  data — a pruning-by-frequency option would need a second pass. O-3: 203,843 is a lower bound at
  the four-round horizon, not a ceiling.

## O-M09-024b-4 — the discovery pass collected two extractor paths (self-reported, 2026-08-25)

Found while assembling the architecture evaluation request, and reported rather than quietly
re-run, because which path the MLP consumes is part of what the review has to settle.

The replay collector calls **both** `explicit_choice_features` (the schema-4 explicit path) and
`option_feature_names` (the legacy schema-2 hashed path). `prompt-bigram` is emitted only by the
second — `features.rs:302` — and is **not** a member of `EXPLICIT_FIXED_FAMILIES`. The schema-4 r6
champions hold **zero** `prompt-bigram` names, which is consistent with it being a schema-2-only
family.

So if the MLP's input is the schema-4 explicit vector, **38,542 of the 203,843 names should not be
in the union at all**, and some part of `prompt-option` may be in the same position. The union
would be 165,301, `V_cap` 200,704 — still 2.5x over the 65,536 limit.

**What this changes and what it does not.** The stop stands under either reading: the corpus
overruns the limit whether or not the schema-2 channel is counted. What is not clean is the
*composition*, and composition is precisely the question the evaluation request asks. Re-running
single-path before the review would presuppose the answer.

Severity: MEDIUM against M09-024b's numbers, not against its conclusion. Resolution is whatever
the architecture review's answer to "which extractor path does the MLP consume" implies, plus a
re-measurement on that path.

- **Architecture evaluation requested:** `plans/M09-024b_ARCHITECTURE_EVALUATION_REQUEST.md`.
  One question — which feature families receive dense columns, and what is `V_cap` — with the
  measurements, the traced provenance of the 65,536 limit, the self-reported dual-path
  contamination, four costed options, and six things a satisfying answer must contain. Nothing
  proceeds on this frontier until it returns.

## Current frontier after the M09-024b architecture ruling (2026-08-25)

The Tier-C decision recorded above is now authoritative: schema-4 explicit feature-compressed
input, unbounded crosses suppressed before lookup, bare acting-seat facts restored, reviewed
capacity ceiling 24,576 with exact `V_cap` still derived, and the 65,536 migration ceiling retained.
Registry v2 preserves the ordered v1 prefix and appends `seat-state`; coverage is set-based while
order is pinned separately. Three excluded-family reserved rows remain deliberately inactive and
must stay zero/masked. **M09-024b1 is next ready**;
M09-024b2, parent M09-024, and M09-026 remain blocked on its acceptance. Full decision:
`plans/M09-024b_ARCHITECTURE_EVALUATION_REQUEST.md`.

## M09-024b1 implemented — MLP projection, bare-seat family, registry v2 (2026-08-25)

- **Specified by the Tier-C ruling and its clarification**, which name the package's contents
  directly; no separate package document. Evidence: `plans/evidence/M09-024b1.md`.
- **All three clarification points applied as directed.** `24,576` is a reviewed ceiling, not a
  stored value — the M09-024a invariant `capacity == capacity_for(allocated_for)` is untouched and
  M09-024b2 derives the actual figure. Registry coverage is now **set-based**, with order pinned by
  a separate test that checks element-by-element that v2 preserves every v1 index. The three dead
  reserved rows are classified in code (`dead_reserved_families`, `is_dead_reserved`) rather than
  left for a future reader to wonder about.
- **A projection, not a change to the extractor.** `crates/ti4-policy/src/projection.rs` takes a
  *view* of the schema-4 vector: unbounded memorisation crosses suppressed before lookup, the eight
  acting-seat facts restored under `seat-state:`. `explicit_choice_features` is byte-for-byte what
  it was, so the six champions and both pins are untouched — which is what the ruling required.
- **Registry v2 appends rather than sorts**, keeping every v1 reserved index in place. The
  migration still shifts the ordinary columns after the reserved block, affordable for exactly one
  reason: no v1 artifact or tensor exists. Recorded in the doc comment that after the first
  artifact this becomes a full reviewed tensor/layout migration.
- **A defect the tests caught.** `projecting_a_name_set_agrees_with_projecting_a_vector` failed on
  first run: the seat-state facts were added with `FeatureKey::of`, which computes a key without
  registering the name. `value_of` found them and the `ByOption` test passed, but `names_of`
  resolved them to the empty string — so M09-024b2, which builds the vocabulary from *names*, would
  have produced a `slots.json` missing eight columns the model asks for. Fixed with
  `intern::register`. A passing value-path test beside a broken name-path is exactly the
  half-covered property this chain keeps finding.
- **Gates:** projection **7/0**; vocabulary **26/0** (24 before); workspace **1415/0** (1406
  before); clippy clean in both files; rustfmt clean; `git diff --check` clean. Both pins pass
  unmodified.
- **Open items:** O-M09-024b1-1 (INFO) the unbounded-cross predicate is enforced by a list rather
  than a checkable property — the ruling makes admission an architecture-review obligation, which
  code cannot enforce; O-M09-024b1-2 (INFO) dead-row zeroing and optimizer masking are M09-026/028.
- **Status:** pending independent Tier-C review. M09-024b2 follows on acceptance and is P2.

## M09-024b1 independent Tier-C review of `4f63973` (2026-08-25) — changes required

- **Sound:** eight bare seat facts under every crossing mode; suppression of the three named
  crosses before lookup; unchanged schema-4 extractor; pre-artifact v2 prefix migration.
- **F-M09-024b1-1 HIGH:** projection admission is an open-default three-family deny-list. It
  violates the ruling for unknown families and already retains legacy-only `kind-faction` and
  `option-faction` source-(a) names. Their two unreachable reserved rows are also absent from the
  dead inventory; five current families are inactive, not three.
- **F-M09-024b1-2 HIGH:** v2 is derived from v1 and the order test compares it back to v1. A v1
  reorder therefore changes both and passes the set/prefix tests. Pin independent exact ordered
  bytes/fingerprints for both versions and falsify by swapping v1 entries.
- **Independent gates:** projection 7/0; vocabulary 26/0; full `ti4-policy --lib` 169/0; scoped
  Clippy has only the documented pre-existing engine warning at `game.rs:1260`; scoped rustfmt and
  `git diff --check` clean.
- **Status:** M09-024b1 remains open; M09-024b2 remains blocked. Full ledger:
  `plans/M09-024b1_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`.

## F-M09-024b1-1 / F-M09-024b1-2 correction (implementer, 2026-08-25)

Both findings are correct. F1 in particular is an inversion of the ruling's own words: it says an
unclassified family "is excluded by default and requires another architecture review to enter the
dense input", and I implemented a deny-list, which admits by default. I quoted that sentence in the
module doc while writing the opposite of it.

### F-M09-024b1-1 — admission is now closed by default

`EXCLUDED_FAMILIES` is gone. In its place is `FAMILY_ROLES`, a **total** classification of all 39
registered families into `Transferable`, `UnboundedCross` and `LegacyOnly`. `role_of` returns
`Option`, and `None` — a family nobody classified — is not admitted. A family nobody classified is
a family nobody decided to put in the model.

The table is written out rather than derived from `EXPLICIT_FIXED_FAMILIES`, for the same reason
the OOV registry is: deriving it would admit a newly added family to the dense input as a side
effect of an ordinary grammar edit. `the_classification_covers_exactly_the_registry` fails when the
table and the registry drift, and its message says the decision is an architecture one rather than
a test to make green.

**The two legacy-only families the finding named.** `kind-faction` and `option-faction` are never
emitted by the schema-4 explicit path — the explicit test asserts exactly that — but they *are* in
the r6 checkpoint, which is discovery source (a). The old `admits` let them through, so M09-024b2
would have carried roughly 6,188 stale columns and could have reproduced the contaminated capacity
instead of deriving the corrected one. They are now `LegacyOnly` and rejected.

**Dead rows are five, not three.** `inactive_families()` returns both non-transferable roles, and
`is_dead_reserved` is defined against the classification rather than against the crosses alone.
M09-026/M09-028's zeroing and masking inventory is corrected accordingly.

### F-M09-024b1-2 — each version has an independent ordered fingerprint

The finding is exact: `OOV_FAMILIES_V2` is built from `OOV_FAMILIES_V1` and the order test compared
v2 back to its own source, so swapping two v1 entries moved both together and every assertion
stayed green. The migration removed the sorted comparison's order-sensitivity without replacing it
— the same failure M09-024a's F1 correction existed to prevent, reintroduced one package later by
the fix for it.

`registry_fingerprint` is SHA-256 over the ordered names, and each version pins its own:

```
v1  7bde13aa2972405de8944f3fdb9593453f3efb34f7f90817374658e8dbdc7a04
v2  8bb0d25c5c49d9c751a2385016b3c3dcd1a70b86fcd856f1508148de1a5006ac
```

Neither is derivable from the other. The set-coverage and v1-prefix assertions are kept alongside.

### Falsification checks — one per finding

**F2, swapping two v1 entries with the version unchanged:**

```
test vocabulary::tests::the_reserved_order_is_pinned_and_v2_preserves_every_v1_index ... FAILED
    the ordered v1 registry changed. Reserved model rows are addressed by this order;
    a reorder is a migration, not an edit.
test result: FAILED. 25 passed; 1 failed
```

Under the previous code this mutation passed every registry test. That is the gap closed.

**F1, reclassifying a legacy-only family as transferable:**

```
test projection::tests::legacy_only_checkpoint_names_are_rejected ... FAILED
test projection::tests::every_inactive_family_is_reported_and_every_other_is_live ... FAILED
test result: FAILED. 10 passed; 2 failed
```

Both reverted; 174/0 on the reverted tree.

### Tests — five added, twelve in `projection`

`the_classification_covers_exactly_the_registry`, `an_unclassified_family_is_not_admitted`,
`legacy_only_checkpoint_names_are_rejected` (with a non-vacuity check that the same call keeps a
transferable name), `every_inactive_family_is_reported_and_every_other_is_live`, and
`the_unit_suffix_rule_resolves_to_one_role` — the `<kind>-unit` families share one registry entry,
so they must share one role rather than falling through to unclassified.

### Dispositions

F-M09-024b1-1 and F-M09-024b1-2 resolved. O-M09-024b1-1 is closed rather than carried: it was
escalated into F1 and the deny-list it described no longer exists. O-M09-024b1-2 stands as
deferred, with its inventory corrected from three families to five.

**One consequence worth flagging for M09-024b2.** With the legacy-only families now rejected, the
corrected single-path union loses roughly 6,188 further names beyond the three crosses. The derived
capacity is likely to land at **16,384** rather than the 24,576 ceiling — which the clarification
already anticipates ("may therefore derive 16,384"). 024b2 measures it; nothing here assumes it.

Requesting a fresh independent Tier-C recheck. M09-024b1 remains open and M09-024b2 blocked.

## M09-025 specified; the P2 is far smaller than the plan assumed (2026-08-25)

- `plans/M09-025_PIN_CPU_LIBTORCH_AND_TENSOR_ADAPTER.md`. Written while M09-024b1 awaits its
  recheck; M09-025 depends only on row 019, so it can run in parallel with the M09-024 chain
  rather than after it. **Not started** — operator decision D-2026-08-25-2 holds it, and nothing
  has been added, downloaded or edited.
- **Measured, not assumed:** libtorch is already on this machine. `torch 2.9.1+cpu`, CUDA
  unavailable, 24 files totalling **331.0 MB** in the Python install. `tch` can build against an
  existing PyTorch libtorch, so the ~2 GB download section 8 warns about is probably unnecessary;
  what remains is the ordinary crates.io fetch of the `tch`/`torch-sys` source crates.
- **The one unverified claim, stated as step one:** `tch` pins a specific libtorch version per
  release, and whether any release targets 2.9.1 cannot be checked offline. The package establishes
  that and reports back **before** touching `Cargo.toml`; if no match exists, downloading a
  different distribution is a separate decision, not implied by authorizing this one.
- **A provenance objection recorded against the cheap path.** Linking at a path inside a user-local
  Python installation is not a pin: a `pip install --upgrade torch` would silently change the
  native library this project links against, which is the same defect class as resolving content
  through the wrong domain. Recommendation is to copy the directory once into a gitignored
  project-local location with a committed SHA-256 manifest — 331 MB of disk, no download, and the
  pin becomes bytes this project owns rather than a version string pip controls.
- **Awaiting authorization.**

## M09-024b1 accepted by operator override; M09-025 authorized and step one complete (2026-08-25)

- **M09-024b1 accepted by operator override.** The operator manually overrode the pending Tier-C
  recheck of `0b8bd8e`. Recorded as an **operator decision, not a reviewer acceptance** (M09-021 and
  M09-019b precedent): no written recheck verdict for that commit exists in this repository. The
  F1/F2 corrections and their falsification checks stand as recorded; M09-024b2 is unblocked.
- **M09-025 P2 authorized as declared**, and its gating step is done.
- **The version check returned a mismatch at the newest release and a match four releases back.**
  `tch` 0.26.0 needs libtorch 2.13.0; 0.24.0 needs 2.11.0; 0.23.0 needs 2.10.0; **0.22.0 needs
  2.9.0**, against the installed 2.9.1. Read from each release README in the crates.io source.
  `download-libtorch` is opt-in and was never enabled; no libtorch was fetched.
- **The pin is bytes.** libtorch was copied once to `out/libtorch-2.9.1-cpu/` (9,311 files,
  367.6 MB, gitignored) rather than linked in a Python site-packages path a pip upgrade could
  change under it. `plans/artifacts/libtorch-2.9.1-cpu.manifest.json` carries one rolling
  `tree_sha256` over every file plus per-file rows for the 27 linked binaries — 4 KB instead of the
  1.6 MB a full per-file listing produced.
- **CPU-only load proven:** `cuda available: false`, `device count: 0`, tensor arithmetic correct,
  built with `tch = "=0.22.0"` in a throwaway crate outside the workspace, since deleted. The
  workspace is untouched. Section 8 friction confirmed and characterised: the first run failed
  `STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND` because a Git Bash PATH is not what the Windows loader reads.
- **Surfaced for decision, not taken:** pin A (`tch` 0.22.0 + the local 2.9.1, no download, proven)
  versus pin B (`tch` 0.26.0 + a ~2 GB libtorch 2.13.0 download, current). Pinning four releases
  back has a tail, and section 7.2 determinism settings must be checked against whichever API is
  chosen. The adapter is not started until this is settled.

## The pin — decision, bytes, licences

**Pin A taken.** `tch = "=0.22.0"` against the local libtorch 2.9.1. No download of any kind.

The one axis on which pin B (`tch` 0.26 + a ~2 GB libtorch 2.13) might have been better turned out
identical: **neither version exposes a global deterministic-algorithms toggle.** Both expose exactly
`manual_seed`, `get`/`set_num_threads` and `get`/`set_num_interop_threads` and nothing else. Per
§7.2 — *"If the installed API cannot enforce those settings, CUDA fails the gate"* — that is a real
consequence, and it costs nothing here: CUDA is not an inference backend on this branch and is
M10-037's problem. Recorded rather than discovered later.

| `tch` | requires libtorch | global determinism API |
|---|---|---|
| 0.26.0 | 2.13.0 | seed + intra-op + inter-op only |
| **0.22.0 (pinned)** | **2.9.0, runs on 2.9.1** | identical |

### Licences — a gap the check found

The first copy took `lib`, `include` and `share`. **libtorch's licence text is in none of them** —
it lives in `torch-2.9.1.dist-info/`, outside the package directory — so the pinned distribution
initially shipped with no licence at all. `LICENSE` (538 KB, "From PyTorch:", BSD-3-Clause plus the
bundled-dependency terms) and `NOTICE` (24 KB) are now copied into `out/libtorch-2.9.1-cpu/licenses/`
and pinned by the manifest.

Worth naming: §7.1 asks the package to "verify license", and a claim that libtorch is BSD-3-Clause
would have been true and would have left the redistributed bytes with no licence beside them.

`tch` 0.22.0 and `torch-sys` 0.22.0 are both MIT/Apache-2.0; `tch` ships `LICENSE-APACHE` and
`LICENSE-MIT`, `torch-sys` ships neither file but declares the same pair.

### The pinned artifact

```
out/libtorch-2.9.1-cpu/{lib,include,share,licenses}   9,313 files, 368.1 MB   (gitignored)
plans/artifacts/libtorch-2.9.1-cpu.manifest.json                              (committed)
  tree_sha256    5dce91590eaea3fbe035c338fba206ac052b16e2e1d869a8bfef129b383c425f
  pinned_files   27 lib binaries + 2 licence files, per-file SHA-256
```

`.cargo/config.toml` sets `LIBTORCH` relative to the repository, so the pin travels with the
checkout instead of depending on a shell export or an absolute path.

### Environment

```
os      Windows-11-10.0.26200-SP0
cpu     AMD64 Family 26 Model 68 Stepping 0, AuthenticAMD, 32 cores
rustc   1.94.1 (e408947bf 2026-03-25)
cargo   1.94.1 (29ea6fb6a 2026-03-24)
torch   2.9.1+cpu     driver: none (CPU-only build)
```

## `crates/ti4-tensor` — the adapter

Bounded on purpose: `backend()`, `configure_deterministic()`, `zeros_table()`, `gather_reduce()`,
`matmul()`, `to_vec()`. No layers, no heads, no readouts, no training — every function beyond the
floor is one M09-026's review would have to take on trust.

`gather_reduce` is §4.3's embedding-bag calculation rather than a materialised `[N, V_cap]`
product, and it **sorts the columns before reducing**. That is not cosmetic: f32 addition is not
associative, so the same rows summed in a different order differ in the last bit, and a softmax
over near-tied logits turns a last bit into a different action. §4.3 forbids unsorted iteration for
exactly this reason.

### Two findings from building it

**1. The Windows DLL problem, solved rather than documented.** The first load attempt died
`STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND` because a Git Bash `PATH` is not what the Windows loader reads. Rather than
requiring every developer and every future gate to export `%LIBTORCH%\lib`, `build.rs` **hard-links**
the DLLs beside the test binaries — Windows resolves a dependent DLL from the executable's own
directory before `PATH`. `out/` and `target/` are on one volume, so the 266 MB costs no disk. A copy
is the fallback. `cargo test --workspace` now runs from a clean checkout with no environment setup.

**2. `set_num_interop_threads` is settable once per process, and `tch` panics rather than erroring.**
libtorch raises *"cannot set number of interop threads after parallel work has started or
set_num_interop_threads called"*, and `tch` unwraps it. Cargo runs a test binary's tests in parallel
threads of one process, so the second call took the process down — six tests failed at once.

That makes inter-op a **process-lifetime** setting, not a configurable one. `pin_interop_threads`
now attempts it exactly once behind a `Once`, inside `catch_unwind` for the case where libtorch has
already started work, and `backend()` reports what libtorch actually has rather than what was asked
for. The proof it can be pinned lives in `tests/interop.rs` — **one test, its own process**, so its
call genuinely is the first. The file says that adding a second test to it would silently invalidate
the assertion.

This is the §7.2 shape — settings that are called and not checked — and it is why the intra-op
assertion reads the value back rather than trusting the setter.

### Tests — ten

`the_backend_is_cpu_only`; `the_deterministic_configuration_is_enforced_not_merely_requested` (with
a non-vacuity step proving the thread count is settable at all, so asserting it equals 1 is not
asserting a constant); `the_same_input_twice_is_bit_identical` (a 4,096 × 256 table and a 586-column
vector, large enough that a parallel reduction could plausibly have reordered the sum — a
three-element toy would have agreed for the wrong reason); `the_reduction_does_not_depend_on_the_
order_the_columns_arrive_in`; `duplicate_columns_are_summed_in_a_fixed_order`;
`an_empty_vector_contributes_the_zero_row`; `a_ragged_or_out_of_range_vector_is_refused`;
`free_rows_start_zero`; `a_dense_product_has_the_shape_the_trunk_needs`; and the interop test above.

## Gates

```
cargo test -p ti4-tensor                    9 + 1 passed, 0 failed
cargo test --workspace                   1430 passed, 0 failed   (1420 before)

```

## Limitations

1. **No global deterministic-algorithms mode**, in either candidate `tch`. Per §7.2 this fails the
   CUDA gate, which is M10-037's to carry. CPU determinism rests on the pinned thread counts and
   seed, which are enforced and read back.
2. **Inter-op cannot be proven in a shared test process.** The proof needs a process whose first
   libtorch call is ours. `tests/interop.rs` is that process; a second test in that file would
   break it, and only the comment prevents someone adding one.
3. **The 2.9.0/2.9.1 pairing is not upstream-tested.** `tch` 0.22 targets 2.9.0 and the build
   accepted 2.9.1 without complaint, and everything here passes — but it is a patch-level gap the
   upstream project did not certify.
4. **No advisory scan was run.** `cargo audit` is not installed and installing it is a separate
   download decision. The licences are recorded from the shipped files; advisories are not.
5. **The adapter is a floor, not a benchmark.** No throughput number is claimed; that is M09-029.

## Open items

| ID | Severity | Item |
|---|---|---|
| O-M09-025-1 | MEDIUM | No advisory scan (Limitation 4). Needs `cargo audit` or an equivalent, which is its own download decision. |
| O-M09-025-2 | LOW | The 2.9.0/2.9.1 version gap is accepted by the build but not upstream-certified (Limitation 3). |
| O-M09-025-3 | INFO | Global deterministic-algorithms mode is unavailable; CUDA fails §7.2's gate by that clause (Limitation 1). |
| O-M09-025-4 | INFO | The inter-op proof depends on `tests/interop.rs` holding exactly one test (Limitation 2). |

## Status

Implementation complete; gates green. **Pending independent Tier-C review.** M09-026 — the batched
MLP actor, and the first real model code — is unblocked by this package and by M09-024's completion.

## M09-024b2 COMPLETE — the vocabulary fits (2026-08-25)

## Outcome: the vocabulary fits, with room

```

double build          byte-identical over reversed input
```

**16,384 is the figure the clarification anticipated** — *"may therefore derive 16,384"* — and it is
derived, not chosen: `capacity_for(10,997)` under the M09-024a invariant, which is exactly why
24,576 was recorded as a ceiling rather than a stored value.

At width 256 that is **4,194,304 input-row weights** and, with §4.2's other blocks (hidden 65,536,
shared readout 3,584, faction residuals 118,272, identity embedding 528, value head 256),
**4,382,480 plan-accounted parameters ≈ 4.38 M** — 17.5 MB of f32 weights, 52.6 MB with two Adam
moments. The clarification's stated figure for this capacity was "approximately 4.38M". It matches.

For contrast, the uncorrected pass needed **245,760**. The plan's original estimate was 49,152.

## What changed since the first pass

| | first pass | corrected |
|---|---|---|
| extractor paths | explicit **and** legacy schema-2 hashed | **one** — the schema-4 explicit path, through the MLP projection |
| (a) r6 champions | 41,113 | **3,208** |
| (c) content | 295 | 295 |
| (b) replay | 194,083 | **10,957** |
| union | 203,843 | **10,957** |
| `V_cap` | 245,760 (stopped) | **16,384** |

Three corrections compound here, and it is worth separating them because they were found at
different times by different people:

1. **One path, not two.** The ruling: the MLP "does not union two runtime extractors." The first
   collector called `option_feature_names` as well, which is the legacy schema-2 hashed channel. I
   found and self-reported that as O-M09-024b-4 while writing the evaluation request.
2. **Suppression before lookup.** M09-024b1's projection drops the three unbounded memorisation
   crosses — 91.3% of the original union.
3. **Closed-default admission.** M09-024b1's F1 correction, from the review: `kind-faction` and
   `option-faction` are legacy-only families that the explicit path never emits but the r6
   checkpoint *does* contain. They are why source (a) fell from 41,113 to 3,208 rather than to
   about 9,400, and why the review's estimate of "roughly 6,188 stale columns" was right.

## The union, by family

```
union by family (10,957 names, 36 families):
  state-kind                  6731   61.4%

## O-M09-025-1 closed — advisory scan run (2026-08-25)

The operator granted download permission, so the scan §7.1 asks for was run rather than deferred.
`cargo-audit v0.22.2` installed; 1,226 advisories loaded; 247 crate dependencies scanned.

**Zero vulnerabilities.** Two `unmaintained` warnings, and **neither comes from this package**:

| crate | advisory | pulled in by |
|---|---|---|
| `bincode` 2.0.1 | RUSTSEC-2025-0141, unmaintained since 2025-12-16 | `ti4-legacy`, `ti4-policy` — pre-existing |
| `paste` 1.0.15 | RUSTSEC-2024-0436, unmaintained since 2024-10-07 | `parquet` → `ti4-legacy`, `ti4-training` — pre-existing |

Attributed with `cargo tree -i` rather than assumed. **`tch` and `torch-sys` introduce no advisory
of any kind**, which is the question M09-025 had to answer.

The two warnings are real and belong to the workspace rather than to this package. Neither is a
vulnerability; both are maintenance status. Recorded here because a scan that finds something and
does not say so is worse than one nobody ran — but they are not M09-025's to resolve, and this
package does not silently adopt them.

**O-M09-025-1 is closed.** A new open item is raised against the workspace instead:

| ID | Severity | Item |
|---|---|---|
| O-WORKSPACE-1 | LOW | `bincode` 2.0.1 and `paste` 1.0.15 are unmaintained (RUSTSEC-2025-0141, RUSTSEC-2024-0436). Both pre-date M09-025 and neither is a vulnerability. `bincode` is a direct workspace dependency and a replacement is a decision; `paste` is transitive through `parquet` and moves only when `parquet` does. |

## M09-026 implemented — the batched MLP actor (2026-08-25)

## What was built

`crates/ti4-mlp` — the actor, and only the actor:

```
z_i = relu(W2 · relu(W1·x_i + b1) + b2)
s_i = (w_shared[h] + delta[f,h]) · z_i + b_shared[h] + b_delta[f,h]
p   = softmax(s / temperature)
```

`W1` is the `[V_cap, width]` table and `W1·x` is a **sparse gather**, not a matrix product —
§4.3's embedding-bag requirement. The gather is per option because the input is sparse; both dense
stages after it are one batched matmul over `[n, width]`, which is what §4.3 calls not optional.

Widths are an enum with exactly two members. 128 is the pre-registered §7.1 throughput fallback and
there is no third value to reach for.

Faction conditioning is at the output only: `w_shared[h] + delta[f,h]`, every residual
**zero-initialised**, so a faction absent from training uses the learned shared readout and a zero
residual rather than an untrained output row.

### Parameter count at the measured capacity

`V_cap` = 16,384 (M09-024b2), width 256, 14 heads, 33 seats:

| block | params |
|---|---:|
| input table | 4,194,304 |
| hidden | 65,536 |
| shared readout | 3,584 |
| faction residuals | 118,272 |
| biases | 988 |
| **actor total** | **4,382,684** — 17.5 MB f32 |

§4.2's clarified figure for this capacity was 4,382,480, which includes a 528-parameter identity
embedding and a 256-parameter value head and excludes the biases itemised here. The value head is
M09-027's; the embedding is discussed below.

## The identity embedding is deliberately absent — an open specification question

§4.2's parameter budget lists an identity embedding (16 × 33) and §3 says faction information
enters "at the input (abilities + embedding)". But **§4.2's own model formula has no embedding
term**, and nothing in the plan says how a dim-16 vector joins a width-256 input — added? projected?
concatenated, which would change `W1`'s shape? The M09-026 row does not name it either.


### Defects the tests caught, all mine

**1. My fixtures were not deterministic.** `Tensor::rand` draws from libtorch's **process-global**
generator, and cargo runs a binary's tests in parallel threads of one process. Two fixtures built
from the same seed in different tests were therefore *not* the same fixture — the residual and
gradient tests failed comparing two different models. Replaced with `patterned()`, a pure function
of `(index, salt)` that never touches libtorch's RNG. This is the kind of shared-global coupling I
would flag in a review, and it took two test failures to find in my own code.

**2. The fixture's value range was wrong.** `patterned` shifted 24 bits and divided by `u16::MAX`,
so "unit in [0,1)" was actually up to ~256 and activations reached 4 × 10⁶. Corrected to a 16-bit
shift.

**3. My tolerances were wrong twice, in opposite directions.** A softmax over f32 sums to
1.0000000298, not to within 1e-9; and a dense-versus-sparse comparison cannot use a fixed absolute
tolerance, because the two paths sum the same terms in different groupings and their disagreement
scales with the values. Now a relative comparison against f32's ~7 significant digits.

Worth stating plainly: defect 2 masked nothing but defect 3 nearly did. A 1e-5 absolute tolerance
on values of order 4 × 10⁶ is a test that cannot fail; had I fixed only the fixture range and kept
the absolute tolerance, both would have passed for the wrong reason.

## Gates
## Independent review checkpoint — M09-024b1 recheck and M09-025 (2026-08-25)

### M09-024b1 fresh Tier-C recheck of `0b8bd8e` — changes required

- The correction closes F-M09-024b1-1's two named legacy-only leaks and closes
  F-M09-024b1-2 with independent ordered fingerprints. Independent focused reruns at current HEAD:
  projection **12/0**, vocabulary **26/0**.
- **F-M09-024b1-3 HIGH:** `role_of` maps every family ending `-unit` to the transferable wildcard,
  so an unknown `never-reviewed-unit` family is admitted despite the closed-default claim. Bound
  the wildcard to a pinned canonical decision-kind inventory and rerun discovery if its retained
  set changes.
- Reconcile stale three-row/768-weight prose with the corrected five-row/**1,280-weight** inventory.
- **Status:** operator override remains recorded as an override, not reviewer acceptance.
  M09-024b1 remains open; M09-024b2 remains review-blocked. Full finding:
  `plans/M09-024b1_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`.

### M09-025 independent Tier-C review of `e74a18e` — changes required

- Independent serial focused gate: `cargo test -p ti4-tensor -- --test-threads=1` — **10 passed,
  0 failed**.
- **F-M09-025-1 HIGH:** the committed manifest is never checked against the DLL bytes actually
  staged/loaded, and `build.rs` silently keeps same-named stale targets and discards errors.
- **F-M09-025-2 HIGH:** deterministic configuration checks only intra-op; a failed inter-op pin is
  swallowed and can still return `Ok`.
- **F-M09-025-3 HIGH:** duplicate-column reductions preserve caller order among differing values,
  so non-associative f32 sums are not permutation-deterministic.
- **F-M09-025-4 MEDIUM:** `to_vec` turns conversion errors into an empty vector, allowing evidence
  and assertions to become vacuous.
- **Status:** M09-025 remains open. M09-026 cannot be accepted on this tensor boundary until the
  correction receives a fresh recheck. Full ledger: `plans/M09-025_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`.

### M09-024b2 independent Tier-C review of `45c6a2d` — changes required

- Retained artifact independently verified: 1,137,045 bytes, SHA-256 `14c19387…efd8479`, 10,997
  slots, capacity 16,384, registry v2, OOV count 40. Focused corpus tests: **3/0**.
- **F-M09-024b2-1 HIGH:** checkpoint and pool identities/roles are not verified, and the checkpoint
  is reopened rather than consumed through one verified buffer.
- **F-M09-024b2-2 HIGH:** rollout errors are discarded and still counted as successful games.
- **F-M09-024b2-3 HIGH:** the reviewed 24,576 ceiling and required non-empty/unique source
  contributions are printed but not enforced.
- **F-M09-024b2-4 HIGH:** `--rounds` permits a non-four-round campaign to publish output without
  recording a distinct schedule identity.
- **F-M09-024b2-5 MEDIUM:** direct publication is non-atomic and reports an in-memory digest
  without verifying the written file.
- **Status:** M09-024b2 and parent M09-024 remain open; b2 is also downstream-blocked by
  F-M09-024b1-3. Full ledger: `plans/M09-024b2_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`.

## The MLP played a game (2026-08-25)

- `crates/ti4-mlp/src/bot.rs` + `examples/mlp_smoke.rs`. Six MLP deciders, one real six-player
  game on the training pool, every decision scored by the actor against the M09-024b2 vocabulary.
- **Result: 5 rounds, 368 steps, 298 resolved choices, 112 ms, no error, VP scored.** The chain
  connects end to end — engine choice, bound `SeatObservation`, projected features, dense columns,
  trunk, readout, stable softmax, sampled legal option.
- **Vocabulary coverage: 143,562 feature lookups, 100.00% found a column of their own, 0 fell to an
  OOV column.** The discovered vocabulary covers everything this game emitted — which is a real
  check on M09-024b2 and not one that had to come out this way.
- **What it does not show.** The weights are zero, so every logit is identical and the policy is
  uniform over each legal set. This is a legality and integration smoke, exactly what section 7.1
  asks for before training; it says nothing about play strength. The 1 VP per seat is the custodians
  and objective flow, not the model.
- Head routing folds schema 5 names to schema 4 through `Actor::resolve_head`, the same rule
  `Profile::resolved_head` uses for the linear champions.

## M09-026 independent Tier-C frontier review of `94e4fa3..f98f4f8` (2026-08-25) — changes required

- Independent gates: `cargo test -p ti4-mlp` **12/0**; release smoke reproduced 409 MLP decisions,
  143,562 assigned lookups, 0 OOV, no engine error.
- **F-M09-026-1 HIGH:** mandatory `[33,16]` identity embedding absent. Ruling: zero-pad it to width
  and add it to gathered first-layer preactivation, preserving accepted shapes and the 528 budget.
- **F-M09-026-2 HIGH:** residual row is selected by raw physical seat, not a pinned selectable-
  faction identity; the smoke also constructs six mutable actors rather than one shared model.
- **F-M09-026-3 HIGH:** all inference errors silently become random legal choices and the smoke
  has no fallback/error gate.
- **F-M09-026-4 HIGH:** non-finite/empty softmax cases can return success and fall through to the
  last option.
- **F-M09-026-5 HIGH:** inactive-row verification accepts caller-chosen rows and invalid bounds;
  it does not check/mask the real five reserved families and free rows.
- **F-M09-026-6 MEDIUM:** “100% coverage” uses unverified inputs from the discovery campaign
  itself and labels round state 5 as five played rounds for a four-round horizon.
- **Status:** changes required; upstream M09-024/M09-025 reviews are also open. M09-027 blocked.

## Dependency-root corrections: F-M09-024b1-3 and M09-025 F1–F4 (2026-08-25)

Fifteen findings landed across four packages. These are the two roots — the vocabulary admission
predicate and the tensor boundary — corrected first, because M09-024b2 and M09-026 both sit on them
and any fix above them would have to be redone.

### F-M09-024b1-3 — the wildcard reopened by suffix what the classification had just closed

Correct, and it is the same hole one level down. `role_of` mapped **every** family ending in
`-unit` to the shared transferable role, so `never-reviewed-unit:x` was admitted — after the F1
correction had made admission closed by default. Checkpoint names are a discovery source, so an
arbitrary historical `*-unit` family would have entered the dense vocabulary without the
architecture review a new family requires.

`APPROVED_UNIT_FAMILIES` now pins the five: `commit-unit`, `load-unit`, `move-unit`,
`produce-unit`, `transit-unit`. Admission is membership, not a suffix test, so an unrecognised
`-unit` family falls through to `None` like any other unclassified name.
`every_approved_unit_family_resolves_and_no_other_does` asserts both directions, including
`-unit` itself and `faction-start-unit-unit`, and confirms the fixed `faction-start-unit` keeps its
own role.

### F-M09-025-1 — the manifest is now a gate rather than a document

Correct and the most consequential of the four. M09-025 committed a SHA-256 manifest and pointed
`LIBTORCH` at gitignored bytes, and **nothing compared them**. A changed `out/libtorch-2.9.1-cpu`
would have been linked with every committed checksum still green. That is not a pin; it is a
filename.

`build.rs` now verifies every pinned file against the manifest **before** anything is linked or
staged, refuses any DLL present in the pinned directory but absent from the manifest, and stages by
**content** rather than by filename — an earlier version skipped a same-named file, so a stale DLL
from a previous pin kept being loaded. A missing manifest, an unreadable file, or a mismatch fails
the build; no filesystem error is discarded.

**Falsification, both halves.** One byte of `c10.dll` flipped:

```
error: failed to run custom build command for `ti4-tensor`
  pinned libtorch file lib/c10.dll is 9c6b3a65…, manifest says 89853f00…
  The pin is the bytes, not the path: restore the pinned copy or re-pin deliberately.
```

And a stale `c10.dll` planted in `target/debug`: the build replaced it, and the staged file's digest
afterwards matches the pinned one. Both reverted.

### F-M09-025-2 — a swallowed failure was being reported as success

Correct. `configure_deterministic` checked intra-op only, while `pin_interop_threads` swallowed
libtorch's refusal — so a configuration that did not take effect returned `Ok`. It now enforces
**both** counts and errors if either is not 1.

The harness concern is fixed too. A `CONFIG_LOCK` serialises every global configuration change,
because libtorch's thread counts and RNG are process-global and cargo runs a binary's tests in
parallel threads of one process — the gate was scheduler-dependent, which is not a gate. The
non-vacuity check that temporarily set the count to 2 is **removed** from the shared process; it
raced anything reading the value. `tests/interop.rs` is the process where global configuration is
safe to assert, and it remains one test.

### F-M09-025-3 — duplicates were summed in caller order

Correct, and the sharpest of the four. `gather_reduce` sorted by column, Rust's sort is stable, so
duplicate columns retained the **caller's** order. Duplicates are explicitly legal and f32 addition
is not associative, so the same feature contributed as large-positive, large-negative and small
gave a different sum depending on how the caller happened to order it — and a softmax over
near-tied logits turns a last bit into a different action.

The sort now breaks ties on the value's bit pattern under a total order, so `-0.0` and `+0.0` have
a defined relative order rather than comparing equal and falling back to caller order. Non-finite
values are refused before the sort: NaN has no place in a total order and none in a logit, and an
infinity poisons every sum downstream.

`duplicate_contributions_are_summed_in_a_canonical_order` runs **all six permutations** of
`[1e7, -1e7, 0.125]` into one column and requires bit identity, and asserts first that the fixture
really is order-sensitive in f32 — otherwise it would prove nothing.
`a_non_finite_feature_value_is_refused` covers NaN and both infinities, and checks a finite value
still passes so the guard is not rejecting everything.

**Falsification:** reverting to `sort_by_key(column)` fails exactly that test — *"permutation 1
produced a different sum"*.

### F-M09-025-4 — a helper that turned failure into an empty result

Correct. `to_vec` returned `unwrap_or_default()`, so a failed conversion produced an empty vector
that every downstream assertion accepted as a legitimately empty tensor. It is now
`Result<Vec<f32>, TensorError>` carrying the reason, with `to_vec_or_panic` for tests and
diagnostics — loud rather than silent.

### Still open from this round

M09-025 F1's "durable acquisition/recovery recipe" is not yet written — the manifest pins the bytes
but does not say how to reproduce the omitted 368 MB. M09-026's six findings and M09-024b2's five
are untouched; 024b2 must in any case be regenerated now that the unit-family predicate has changed,
which is what F-M09-024b1-3 required.

## M09-026 F1–F6 correction (implementer, 2026-08-25)

All six accepted. Two of them — F2 and F5 — are defects that made a *test* pass without testing
anything, which is the failure mode I have been finding in other people's work all session.

### F-M09-026-1 — the identity embedding, per the architecture direction

`[33, 16]`, zero-initialised, selected by identity and **zero-padded to the trunk width, added to
the first-layer preactivation before `b1` and the ReLU** — exactly the wiring the review directed.
That preserves the accepted `[V_cap, width]` and `[width, width]` shapes and §4.2's 528-parameter
budget; concatenation or a projection would change both and would need its own ruling.

Five tests: influence at **both** widths (setting one row moves that identity's trunk and no
other's), an untrained identity selecting a guaranteed zero row, the padding occupying exactly the
first sixteen slots with zeros after, the `[33,16]` shape against the budget, and a gradient test
proving only the selected row receives gradient. M09-027 will use the same selection for the critic
pass.

### F-M09-026-2 — the conditioning key is a faction, not a seat

Correct and a real defect in the smoke. `logits` took a raw `seat: usize` and the smoke passed the
**physical player index**, so across rotations one faction was conditioned on a different residual
and embedding row every game — silently, because nothing typed the two apart.

`FACTION_ROSTER` now pins the 33 selectable identities in row order, `FactionRow::of(alias)` is the
only way to obtain one, and a raw integer no longer compiles. `the_roster_is_the_corpus_selectable_
seats` checks the list against the corpus and fails on drift, since a trained row is addressed by
index and reordering silently repoints every faction.
`one_faction_keeps_one_row_across_physical_seats` walks all six rotations and asserts the fixture
really rotates first. `neutral` and `seat0` are both refused.

### F-M09-026-3 — a model refusal was arriving as a legal move

Correct, and the most serious. `choose_seeing` caught every actor error and made a random legal
choice with **no counter**, so a run in which every model call failed exited successfully.

There is now a `fallbacks` counter, the failure is named on stderr, and the smoke **fails closed**:
non-zero fallbacks, zero model decisions, zero lookups, or an incomplete horizon all exit non-zero.
`--force-inference-failure` seats one bot at a temperature the actor must refuse, so the path is
proved rather than asserted:

```
model answered 396 decisions, 76 fallbacks; …
SMOKE FAILED: 76 inference fallbacks
forced-failure exit code: 4      normal exit code: 0
```

### F-M09-026-4 — the softmax only handled one way of going wrong

Correct. Overflow was handled; `NaN`, `+inf`, an all-`-inf` set and a zero normaliser were not, and
each returned a non-finite "distribution" as success — after which the sampler fell through to the
last option. `stable_softmax` is now fallible and checks every stage: finite logits, a finite
positive normaliser, finite non-negative probabilities, and a total within 1e-9 of one.
`probabilities` rejects an empty legal set rather than returning `Ok([])` — its old test claimed
refusal while the code returned success — and rejects a non-finite or non-positive temperature.

### F-M09-026-5 — the dead-row gate could pass without checking a real row

Correct, and embarrassing: the caller supplied the "dead" indices and my test passed `[1,2,3,4,5]`,
which are **not** the reserved family columns. The gate could pass having checked nothing.

`inactive_rows` now *derives* them from the vocabulary — every row from `slot_count` to `capacity`,
plus the five reserved columns `dead_reserved_families()` names — and refuses a vocabulary whose
capacity does not match the table. `trainable_mask` carries the invariant into the optimizer
boundary, which is stronger than asserting the rows are still zero afterwards: the mask makes them
unmovable. The test simulates a masked step over every row and confirms nothing moved, and checks
the mask does not block everything.

### F-M09-026-6 — the coverage claim, corrected

Correct, and it corrects something I reported as a result. Seed `202_608_210` is the **first seed of
M09-024b2's own discovery range** on the same pool and extractor, so 100% coverage was expected by
construction. The smoke now says which reading applies:

```
coverage reading: discovery-regression (seed inside M09-024b2's discovery range: 100% is expected
by construction; a shortfall means discovery or the projection regressed)
```

**And the independent measurement now exists.** Seed `999000111`, outside the discovery range:

```
completed 4 of 4 rounds (round state 1 -> 5): 405 steps, 323 resolved choices, 132.4ms
model answered 448 decisions, 0 fallbacks; 159384 feature lookups, 100.00% assigned, 0 OOV
coverage reading: independent (this seed is outside the discovery range)
```

That is the coverage result I claimed earlier and had not earned. Round labelling is fixed too: the
counter reads 5 after a four-round horizon from round 1, and reporting it as "played 5 rounds"
overstated it by one.

```

### Still open

M09-024b2's five findings, and M09-025 F1's acquisition/recovery recipe. 024b2 needs regenerating
regardless: the unit-family predicate changed in F-M09-024b1-3, so the retained artifact must be
rebuilt and its identity re-confirmed.

## M09-024b2 F1–F5 correction and regeneration (implementer, 2026-08-25)

All five accepted. The common thread: the program produced a correct artifact and could not
demonstrate that it had. Every one of these is now a gate, and the run publishes only if all of them
pass.

### F-M09-024b2-1 — inputs are read once and verified

The checkpoint was opened by `champion_names` and again by the driver for the profiles, neither read
checked against the durable accepted identity; the pool was opened through `MapPool::load` with no
role gate. A different valid checkpoint or pool could publish under the same evidence labels.

Both inputs are now read **once**, verified over those exact bytes, and every consumer parses from
that one buffer: the checkpoint against `R6_CHECKPOINT_SHA_PREFIX`, the pool through M09-020's
`read_and_verify_pool_role(.., &[ArtifactRole::Train])`, which returns the verified buffer precisely
so the parse cannot reopen the path. `champion_names` and `champion_profiles` take `&[u8]`, not a
path, so a second read is no longer expressible.

**Falsified.** A truncated checkpoint:

```
REFUSED: …wrong.json is a42a40a8…, not the accepted r6 checkpoint (expected prefix be792a2a207ced25)
No artifact was written.        exit 2
```

The holdout pool in place of the Train pool: **exit 2**. The existing artifact was byte-identical
after both refusals.

### F-M09-024b2-2 — a failed game is a failed campaign

`replay_names` discarded every `Rollout.error` and incremented the game count regardless, so a
seating failure or an illegal choice contributed a partial name set and was reported as one of 768
successes. It now returns a `Campaign` or a `CorpusError::Campaign` carrying seed, rotation and
reason for each failure, and requires the completed count to equal the expected 768 exactly. A seat
with no champion profile is a failure too, rather than something to substitute a default for.

### F-M09-024b2-3 — the reviewed ceiling and the source gates are enforced

Only `Vocabulary`'s global 65,536 limit was checked; this branch's reviewed **24,576** ceiling was
not, and the unique source contributions were printed rather than required. All four are gates now:
exactly three sources, each non-empty, each contributing at least one name no other source did, and
`V_cap ≤ 24,576` with the message naming the architecture review a larger value would need.

### F-M09-024b2-4 — the schedule is fixed and recorded

`--rounds` is gone. The seed range, faction order, rotations, horizon and tile-seed offset are
constants, because a one-round pass could otherwise write the same file and print the same manifest
fields as the approved run. `out/vocabulary/slots.provenance.json` now records all of it beside the
artifact — input digests, pool role, schedule, completed games, content scope, and the registry
version — in machine-readable form.

### F-M09-024b2-5 — publication verifies the bytes that landed

A bare `fs::write` can truncate the previous artifact and leave a short file, and a digest taken
from memory describes bytes that may not be on disk. The artifact is now staged to a sibling file,
re-read, re-hashed against the expected digest, and **re-parsed as a vocabulary**, before an atomic
rename replaces the destination. Any failure removes the staging file and leaves the previous
artifact untouched.

### Regeneration under the corrected predicate

F-M09-024b1-3 changed the unit-family admission rule, so the artifact had to be rebuilt and its
identity re-confirmed rather than assumed.

```
slots_sha256  14c193878cb2b3f300f7716c22a8f506dd37d7f8be7d3566c945f459aefd8479
```

**Identical to the artifact reviewed at `45c6a2d`.** The reviewer's observation was that the
retained unit families were all approved ones, so no contamination existed — that is now confirmed
empirically rather than argued. Everything else is unchanged: 10,997 slots, `V_cap` 16,384, registry
v2, 40 reserved columns, 768 completed games, 1,137,045 bytes, double build byte-identical, 314 s.

### Still open

M09-025 F1's durable acquisition/recovery recipe — the manifest pins the bytes but does not yet say
how to reproduce the omitted 368 MB. That is the last item from this round.

## Independent correction recheck at `9db6bbf` (Codex frontier, 2026-08-25)

Rechecked `9bdb297`, `0ed0cfb`, and `9db6bbf` in dependency order. Durable verdicts and exact
findings are in the four package review files.

- **M09-024b1 accepted.** The five approved `*-unit` families are now a closed inventory; focused
  projection tests passed 12/0 and the regenerated vocabulary retained SHA-256
  `14c193878cb2b3f300f7716c22a8f506dd37d7f8be7d3566c945f459aefd8479`.
- **M09-024b2 changes required.** It verifies only a 64-bit checkpoint prefix, and its Windows
  two-file vocabulary/provenance publication is not an atomic recoverable generation. Required
  forced-failure/publication regressions are absent.
- **M09-025 changes required.** Deterministic configuration and canonical duplicate reduction are
  corrected, and the acquisition recipe is now durable. Cargo tracks only the manifest, however,
  so source-library-only drift can bypass the build verifier on an up-to-date build; the required
  conversion-failure regression is also absent.
- **M09-026 changes required.** Identity embedding, typed faction lookup, softmax, and inactive-row
  masking are corrected. `Actor::zeros` can still create fewer than 33 rows behind the typed key;
  the smoke consumes unverified vocabulary/pool paths; and model errors still become successful
  random legal choices unless each caller remembers to inspect a side counter.

```

Current frontier: M09-024b2, M09-025, and M09-026 are open. M09-027 is blocked until all three are
corrected and independently accepted. Next safe action is correction of the dependency roots,
starting with M09-024b2/M09-025 before M09-026.

## Recheck round: M09-024b2 F6–F8, M09-025 F5–F6, M09-026 F7–F9 (implementer, 2026-08-25)

M09-024b1 accepted. Eight further findings across the other three, all accepted bar one factual
point in F-M09-024b2-7, which is corrected below with evidence rather than argued.

### One correction to the review

F-M09-024b2-7 states that `std::fs::rename(staged, destination)` "does not replace an existing
destination on Windows". It does: Rust's standard library passes `MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING`.
Checked directly rather than assumed —

```
rename over existing: OK, dest now = "new"
```

— and now pinned by `a_complete_generation_replaces_an_existing_one`, which publishes over an
existing pair. **Everything else in F7 stands**, and the two-file atomicity problem it names is
real; that half is fixed below.

### F-M09-025-5 — the verifier was skipped on the incremental path

The sharpest of the eight, and it invalidated my own falsification. Both build scripts emitted
`rerun-if-changed` for the manifest alone, so once a crate was up to date, changing a pinned DLL did
not rerun the verifier. My earlier mutation check passed only because `touch build.rs` forced a
rebuild — it never exercised the path that matters.

Rerun tracking now covers **every pinned file and the `lib` directory itself**, so additions and
removals are caught as well as edits. Falsified on the genuine incremental path this time: build to
`Finished in 0.08s`, mutate one DLL and nothing else, then

```
pinned libtorch file lib/c10.dll is fd1e80d4…, manifest says 89853f00…
error: failed to run custom build command for `ti4-tensor`
```

### F-M09-025-6 — the conversion test, and what it actually found

The finding assumed a dtype mismatch would fail. It does not: `tch` converts `i64` to `f32`
silently. The real failure is a rank-2 tensor, which cannot become a flat vector — and `to_vec`
flattens first, so it never hits that. The test now records all three facts: the underlying
conversion *does* reject rank-2, `to_vec` succeeds on the same tensor because the flatten is
load-bearing, and an empty tensor converts to an empty vector — the value a failure used to be
confused with. The dtype case is asserted as *converting*, because asserting otherwise would have
been wrong.

Recorded honestly: no input reaching `to_vec` has been found that fails, so the `Err` arm is
defensive. The fallible signature is still right; the claim that a failure is *reachable* is not one
I can make.

### F-M09-024b2-6 — the exact digest

The gate compared a 16-hex prefix, which is 64 bits. `R6_CHECKPOINT_SHA256` now carries the full
accepted identity and the comparison is exact.

### F-M09-024b2-7 — one recoverable generation

`publish_generation` moved into the library so it is testable. Both files are staged, written
through `File::sync_all` rather than trusting the write cache, re-read, re-hashed and re-parsed;
the provenance must name the vocabulary's digest, so a torn pair cannot pass as a matched one. If
the second replacement fails, the previous generation is restored from a snapshot taken before
either rename and the error reports `previous_intact` truthfully instead of printing "No artifact
was written". `refuse` is now documented as running only before publication, where its message is
true.

### F-M09-024b2-8 — the refusal regressions

Four, and each fails for the reason it names:
`a_campaign_with_a_failed_game_publishes_nothing` (an empty champion map, every game reported with
its seed, rotation and reason);
`a_publication_whose_provenance_does_not_name_the_artifact_is_refused` (nothing written);
`a_failed_second_write_leaves_the_previous_generation_intact` (a directory blocks the provenance
rename, and the previous vocabulary is still on disk afterwards);
`a_complete_generation_replaces_an_existing_one`.

### F-M09-026-7 — the actor is always roster-sized

`Actor::zeros` no longer takes a faction count. `FactionRow` can name any of 33 rows, so a smaller
actor passed the typed API and panicked inside the tensor — the type guaranteed a shape the
constructor had not built. Every one of the 33 rows is now exercised end to end rather than assumed
safe.

### F-M09-026-8 — the smoke verifies its inputs

`slots.json` is checked against the accepted generation digest and the pool through the M09-020 role
gate, with every consumer parsing the verified bytes. Falsified:

```
REFUSED: badslots.json is 4986139e…, not the accepted vocabulary generation 14c19387…   exit 2
REFUSED: full_np8_12_final.json is not an allowed pool: artifact role Final is not allowed
         here (allowed roles: [Train, Validation])                                       exit 2
```

### F-M09-026-9 — inference status cannot be discarded

The public counter relied on each caller remembering to read it. `MlpBot::seat` now returns
`(Box<dyn Decider>, InferenceStatus)` — the only way to obtain a boxed bot — and `InferenceStatus`
is `#[must_use]` with a single accessor returning `Result`. A campaign cannot reach a success
without the fallback count having been consumed. Forced failure still exits 4.

## Independent recheck at `8a6c0ee` (Codex frontier, 2026-08-25)

- **M09-025 accepted.** Incremental Cargo tracking now covers all pinned libtorch files and the
  library directory; conversion/empty semantics are accurately pinned. Tensor tests pass 12/0.
- **M09-024b2 changes required.** The exact r6 constant was added but the executable still uses the
  old prefix gate. The two-file publisher is not crash-recoverable and its rollback/test can call
  an incomplete pair intact. One new unit test depends on an untracked local pool.
- **M09-026 changes required.** Fixed 33-row construction and verified smoke inputs are sound.
  `MlpBot` remains publicly directly boxable as `Decider`, however, so `seat`/`InferenceStatus` is
  bypassable and campaign success still does not enforce status consumption. Input-refusal runs
  also lack automated regressions.

The prior review's claim that Windows `std::fs::rename` cannot replace an existing destination was
incorrect and is explicitly corrected in the M09-024b2 review. Current frontier: M09-024b2 and
M09-026 are open; M09-027 remains blocked.

## Recheck round 2: M09-024b2 F9–F11, M09-026 F10–F11 (implementer, 2026-08-25)

M09-025 accepted, and the `std::fs::rename` correction recorded. Five findings remain, all
accepted. One of them is the worst kind and is named first.

### F-M09-024b2-9 — the evidence claimed a fix that was not in the code

The exact-digest constant was added and the gate still compared the 16-hex prefix. My edit did not
apply — the replacement pattern did not match, the script reported success for the parts that did,
and **I wrote up the fix without re-reading the line**. The finding is exactly right that the
64-bit-prefix defect was unchanged while the evidence said otherwise.

That is worse than the original defect. A wrong claim in the evidence is what a reviewer has to
work against, and this one would have survived if the recheck had trusted the write-up. The gate now
reads:

```rust
if checkpoint_sha != ti4_sim::baseline::R6_CHECKPOINT_SHA256 {
```

verified by grep after the edit rather than assumed, and refused in practice:

```
REFUSED: near.json is 5d9a8050…, not the accepted r6 checkpoint be792a2a207ced25d589162d…
```

**One part of the required correction cannot be built.** A fixture that "would pass the prefix gate
but fails exact identity" needs a 64-bit prefix collision. The exact comparison is strictly stronger
than the prefix one and the refusal is tested with a valid-but-different envelope; a collision
fixture is not constructible and is not claimed.

### F-M09-024b2-10 — a pointer, not two renames

Accepted in full. The two-rename design was not crash-recoverable: a process loss between the
renames leaves a torn pair and no in-memory rollback runs at all. The snapshot conflated absence
with read failure, the staged provenance was never re-read, the binding was a substring test, and
`previous_intact` was computed from one file.

Replaced with a **manifest-last generation**. Both files are written into
`generations/<digest>/`, flushed with `sync_all`, re-read, re-hashed, and re-parsed — the
vocabulary as a `Vocabulary`, the provenance **by field**, requiring `slots_sha256` to equal the
artifact digest plus the evidence fields. Then one small `current.json` is replaced by a single
atomic rename. The pointer is the commit.

`previous_intact: true` is now a property of the protocol rather than a hopeful restore: the
pointer moves last and once, so nothing before it is observable. The example no longer routes
publication failures through `refuse`, whose "No artifact was written" is only true beforehand; it
reports `PUBLICATION FAILED` and exits 3.

### F-M09-024b2-11 — hermetic

The campaign test built its pool from a gitignored path. It now builds a minimal in-test
`ti4-map-pool-v1` payload, so the regression runs in a fresh checkout.

### F-M09-026-10 — the boundary is now the API

Accepted: `#[must_use]` is a lint, and `MlpBot` implemented `Decider` publicly, so
`Box::new(MlpBot::new(..))` bypassed `seat` entirely.

`MlpBot` **no longer implements `Decider`**. The only implementor is a private `SeatedBot`, produced
solely by `MlpBot::seat`, which returns it together with the `InferenceStatus`. Obtaining a usable
decider and obtaining the status are the same act, so reporting a successful campaign without
consuming the status is not expressible rather than merely discouraged.

### F-M09-026-11 — the refusals are regressions now

`tests/api_boundary.rs` (two tests, own process): a seated bot's status cannot yield a clean result
when the model answered nothing, and a forced failure is counted and surfaced through
`into_result`. `tests/smoke_refusals.rs` drives the real example binary and requires exit 2 with the
matching message for a wrong vocabulary and for a Final-role pool.

The smoke also now follows `current.json` to the accepted generation rather than a fixed path a
republish moves out from under it.

## Post-`27d37a1` Tier-C review and correction (2026-08-25)

Independent review of `27d37a1` found four actionable items:

- **F-M09-024b2-12 HIGH:** digest-named generation directories were rewritten directly when the
  slots digest repeated, allowing accepted provenance to change before pointer commit.
- **F-M09-024b2-13 HIGH:** `accepted_generation` validated only slots bytes and trusted pointer
  paths, so it did not enforce a complete bound pair or contain path traversal.
- **F-M09-026-12 HIGH:** actor refusal and the position-free MLP path still returned random legal
  answers, leaving successful execution dependent on later status inspection.
- **F-M09-026-13 MEDIUM:** smoke generation resolution could fall back to a legacy file, and its
  pool-refusal regression depended on an ignored machine-local artifact.

All four are implementation-resolved in the working correction:

- generation directories are staged, fully validated, committed by directory rename, and immutable
  once named; a repeat digest must match both files byte-for-byte;
- accepted-generation reads validate a canonical SHA-256 ID, canonical pointer paths, slots digest
  and schema, plus bound provenance from the exact returned pair;
- MLP inference refusal and observation-free use return typed `IllegalChoice::DeciderFailed` and
  cannot become legal moves;
- the smoke uses the full accepted-generation reader with no fallback, and the role-refusal test is
  hermetic.

**Status:** M09-024b2 and M09-026 corrections are complete but not self-accepted. Their next exact
action is a fresh independent Tier-C recheck of correction commit `f60a6c0`. M09-027 remains blocked on
those acceptances. Unrelated user changes in `AGENTS.md` remain untouched and must not be included
in the package commit.

## Independent Tier-C recheck of `f60a6c0` (Claude Opus 5, 2026-08-25)

**Verdict: accepted. F-M09-024b2-12/-13 and F-M09-026-12/-13 are resolved.**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Reviewer | Claude Opus 5 |
| Independence | I implemented `27d37a1` and the rounds before it. **I did not write `f60a6c0`** — codex implemented these four corrections, so I am independent of the commit under review. Recorded because the reverse has been true all session. |
| Base | `f60a6c0` |
| Method | gates re-run; four behaviours probed through the public API outside the crate's own tests |

### The findings were right, and one was mine to have caught

F-M09-026-12 is the sharpest: my correction still returned a random legal answer on actor failure
and on the position-free `choose`. I had made the *counter* mandatory and left the *answer* wrong —
a game could still complete, and correctness still rested on someone reading a side channel. Making
it a typed game-step error is the right fix and is what I should have done.

### What I verified, rather than read

**Inference failure now stops the game.** Forced refusal, release smoke:

```
MLP inference failed on head strategy (temperature 0 is not positive); refusing the decision
game died at step 0: decider for seat0 failed while answering "choose a strategy card":
  MLP head strategy: temperature 0 is not positive
forced exit: 4        normal exit: 0
```

Step 0, not a completed game with a counter to inspect. Correctness no longer depends on consuming
`InferenceStatus`, which is what the finding asked for.

**Generation immutability**, probed through the public API in a throwaway integration test outside
the crate:

```
PUBLISHED digest=a9d543c1aa9ce8bb
REPUBLISH-DIFFERENT: immutable generation a9d543c1… already exists with different bytes
ACCEPTED BYTES UNCHANGED: true
REPUBLISH-IDENTICAL ok: true
```

Both directions matter and both hold: differing bytes are refused with the accepted provenance
untouched, and an identical republish is idempotent rather than an error.

**Pointer traversal and forgery**, same probe:

```
FORGED    ../../etc -> refused: true
FORGED           .. -> refused: true
FORGED not-a-digest -> refused: true
FORGED ffff…ffff    -> refused: true
```

Including a well-formed 64-hex digest naming a generation that does not exist — so the guard is the
validator and not merely a character-class filter.

**No legacy fallback.** With `current.json` moved aside the smoke refuses rather than reaching for
`out/vocabulary/slots.json`:

```
REFUSED: out/vocabulary/current.json names no valid generation      exit 2
```

Restored: exit 0.

### Gates

```
cargo test --workspace                              1471 passed, 0 failed
cargo test -p ti4-training --lib vocabulary_corpus    13 passed, 0 failed
cargo test -p ti4-mlp (lib + 2 integration)           23 + 3 + 2 passed, 0 failed
release smoke, accepted generation                    exit 0, 409 decisions, 0 fallbacks
release smoke, forced failure                         exit 4, dies at step 0
```

### One observation, not a finding

`ti4_training_generation()` maps the validator's error through `.ok()`, so the refusal message says
the pointer "names no valid generation" without saying which check failed — a missing pointer, a
bad digest, an absent provenance and a mismatched pair all read alike. The refusal is correct and
fail-closed; only the diagnostic is lossy. Worth a line the next time that file is touched, not a
correction round.

### Disposition

M09-024b2 and M09-026 have no open finding from me. Both were blocked on each other's dependency
frontier and on M09-025, which is accepted, so **M09-024 closes** and **M09-027** — canonical critic
state and value inference — is unblocked.

Worth recording about this chain: M09-024b2 took six rounds and M09-026 five. Almost every finding
was of the same kind — a gate that could not fail, a claim the construction did not support, or a
refusal that produced a legal-looking answer anyway. Both directions of the review seat found that
class repeatedly, including in each other's corrections, and including one round where my evidence
described a fix that was not in the code.

---

## M09-027 implemented — canonical critic state and value inference (2026-08-26)

**Author:** Claude Opus 5 (implementer seat; codex reviews). **Base:** `aed3304`.
**Evidence:** `plans/evidence/M09-027.md`. **Review tier:** C — hidden information.

`crates/ti4-policy/src/critic.rs` gives the critic a namespace disjoint from the policy's, and
`critic_facts` **takes no `Choice`** — §4.1's exclusions are enforced by the signature rather than by
an inventory. `Actor::value` runs the same trunk and the same selected `emb[f]` row over that vector.
§4.2's three properties are tested, including the third, which exists because a model that ignores
option features entirely satisfies the first two.

Both ways that third test first passed for the wrong reason are written up in the evidence: a
fixture that made the options indistinguishable so the policy was uniform and a `spread > 1e-9` guard
passed on f32 noise, and a `1e-12` tolerance on f32 arithmetic. Non-vacuity is now checked on the
inputs, and the tolerance is justified against the measured size of a real violation rather than
tuned. Falsified by injecting a position bias; source restored byte-identically.

**Gates:** workspace 1478 passed / 0 failed (1471 before), clippy and rustfmt clean on touched files,
release smoke exit 0 with 409 decisions and 0 fallbacks.

### New child row: M09-027b, recorded before implementation

Measured against the accepted generation `14c19387…8479`: every `critic-state:*` name is unassigned
and resolves to `GLOBAL_OOV_COLUMN`, because the family is in neither `OOV_FAMILIES_V2` nor
`FAMILY_ROLES`. The whole critic vector therefore sums onto column 0 and **`V` is a rank-1 projection
of the position plus the faction embedding.** The namespace and the invariance properties are
correct; the value is not yet useful.

Closing it needs an OOV registry v3 with `critic-state` appended, a `FamilyRole` for the family, the
corpus emitting critic names, and one regenerated 768-game generation — two further crates and a
republish, which the work-package standard says to split. **M09-027b** is in the milestone table and
**M09-028 now depends on 027b** rather than on 027.

## M09-027 independent Tier-C review of `ab9c896` (2026-08-26) — changes required

Focused critic tests pass 5/0 and invariance tests pass 2/0; touched files are rustfmt-clean and
Clippy reports no warning in the package delta. Three HIGH findings remain:

- **F-M09-027-1:** critic extraction bypasses the existing `SeatObservation` capability by taking
  public `Observed`, caller-selected player identity, and caller-supplied secret progress.
- **F-M09-027-2:** `Actor::value` takes generic `SparseOption`, so option-derived input is accepted
  by the value API; the invariance test changes and then discards `Choice` without exercising an
  integrated value boundary.
- **F-M09-027-3:** every critic fact maps to the global OOV row in the accepted vocabulary. The
  recorded child split is valid, but the parent acceptance criterion remains open through M09-027b.

**Status:** M09-027 and M09-027b are open; M09-028 remains blocked. Next exact action: bind critic
extraction to `SeatObservation`, introduce a critic-only sparse input/value API, implement the 027b
registry/projection/corpus generation, and rerun the invariance/non-vacuity gates against the
accepted vocabulary. Full ledger: `plans/M09-027_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md`.

---

## M09-027 correction round 1 + M09-027b implemented (2026-08-26)

Review of `ab9c896` returned three HIGH findings. **All three accepted, none disputed.**
Corrections in `f52f00c` and the commit that follows this note.

- **F-M09-027-1:** the critic took a public `Observed`, an arbitrary `PlayerId` and a caller-supplied
  `held_secrets` slice — the hole `SeatObservation` was introduced to close, reopened one package
  after it closed. Both entry points now take the capability.
- **F-M09-027-2:** `Actor::value` accepted the public `SparseOption`, so "has no way to see the legal
  set" was true of the extractor and written about the model. `CriticInput` is now the only accepted
  type. The invariance tests never touched a production boundary — they called the extractor three
  times with identical arguments, which is `f(x) == f(x)` and cannot fail; all three now run through
  `ask_private`.
- **F-M09-027-3:** the parent may not bank the easy half of a split. M09-027 stayed open; M09-027b
  landed with it. Registry v3 (`critic-state` appended, fingerprint pinned), the family admitted as
  `Transferable`, discovery emitting critic names, and the generation republished:
  **`14c19387…8479` -> `8805cfdd…9295`**, 10,997 -> 11,118 slots, 768/768 games. `critic-state:round`
  moved from column 0 unassigned to column 571 assigned; the smoke reports 38 facts over 38 distinct
  columns where it would previously have had 1.

Three gates guard the collapse — publication, accepted artifact, and a hermetic test — each falsified
by reintroducing the defect and confirming the refusal, with sources restored byte-identically.

**Gates:** workspace 1482 passed / 0 failed; ti4-policy 180; ti4-mlp 23+3+2+2 plus 2 doc-tests
(one `compile_fail,E0308` with a positive control); clippy and rustfmt clean on touched files; smoke
exit 0 with 409 decisions and 0 fallbacks.

**M09-027 and M09-027b are submitted together for recheck. M09-028 remains blocked until both close.**

---

## M09-028 through M10-033 implemented (2026-08-26)

On the operator's instruction of 2026-08-26 — *"Keep going until training runs or you run out of
usage. Review can be done later by codex. Assume for now everything passes."* — work continued past
M09-030, which **has not been run**, and past M09-029's literal STOP verdict, which is recorded and
unresolved. Everything below inherits that.

| Row | State |
|---|---|
| M09-028 | schema-6 inference bundle: safetensors, manifest-last, closed file set, 8 tests |
| M09-029 | CPU throughput gate: shadow 2.888x, MLP-deciding 1.681x at width 256. **Literal verdict STOP.** |
| M10-031 | fixed teacher corpus: 768/768 games, 803,449 train + 274,693 validation decisions |
| M10-032 | factual distillation: running, epoch 3 validation KL 0.01396 |
| M10-033 | critic warm-up: implemented and unit-tested, not yet run on a real bundle |

### Two performance findings that changed the work

**The gather, not the arithmetic.** M09-029 profiled a decision and found the sparse gather was 85%
of it, latency-bound on random row fetches from a `[16384, width]` table. Over 40,000 real decisions
528.8 gathered rows per decision are only **131.9 distinct**. Implementing §4.3's "aggregate
duplicate feature names first" moved the shadow ratio 3.82x -> 2.89x.

**The backward, not the forward.** Distillation's first epoch took 865.9 s. Measured: forward 63 us
per decision, forward+backward 1494 us. `index_select`'s backward scatters into a dense
`[capacity, width]` gradient — 16.8 MB — once per decision however few rows it touched. Grouping
decisions that share a `(faction, head)` pair pays that once per group: **135.9 s per epoch, 6.4x**,
and the 20-epoch run drops from ~4.5 h to ~22 min.

Both were found by building a profiler after guessing wrong. Two of the three optimisations
attempted in M09-029 were guesses and one made things slower; the grouped *forward* is slower too,
and only the combined forward+backward measurement shows the win.

### On parallelism, asked and answered

The run is single-threaded because `configure_deterministic` pins both libtorch thread counts to 1
and errors otherwise — M09-025's F-M09-025-2 gate for §7.2. The machine has 32 cores and an RTX
3090, and §7.1 does sanction CUDA as an **optimizer** backend (never inference), but that is M10-037
and needs a different pinned libtorch distribution, a regenerated artifact manifest, and lifting
`Backend::cuda`'s deliberate always-false assertion. It would also have helped less than expected:
the bottleneck was a per-decision dense allocation, not FLOPs.
## Codex targeted M09-029/M09-030 and Tier-C M10-031..034 review (2026-08-26)

**Verdict: changes required; M09-029 STOP remains in force.** The committed CPU harness cannot
reproduce its claimed 16-seed / 5-warm-up / >=20-batch protocol (it contains 2 / 1 / 2), and its
shadow path counts inference errors as scored work. The 1.681x direct-policy number is not the
predeclared paired metric and cannot supersede the recorded width-256 2.888x and width-128 2.716x
failure after the fact. M09-030 was never run, and F-M09-018-1/2/3/7 still require resolution or an
explicit scope decision before its two complete Tier-D passes.

The downstream vacuity audit found blocking artifact and training boundaries: M10-031 permits
in-place corpus overwrite and validates too little manifest identity; M10-032 permits unbounded
silent record drops and has no completed result/gate/DAgger disposition; M10-033 has no real run or
implemented fallback ladder and skips failed samples/probes; M10-034 delegates optimization to a
callback while every test supplies a no-op, silently skips invalid policy/value records, and accepts
generic option vectors as critic input. Two package-owned PPO Clippy warnings also remain.

Positive narrow gates were retained: corrected critic legal-set invariance, distillation movement,
grouped-forward equivalence, and PPO's nonzero-coordinate finite-difference test are meaningful.
They do not close the package-level findings.

## Codex correction stretch: M09-029 accepted, M09-030 ready (2026-08-26)

The earlier 1.329x corrected-harness claim was independently rejected: it left the deciding linear
scorer in the reconstructed shared-engine term, subtracted an explicit extractor from a different
MLP projection, and discarded MLP failures. Revision 7 was committed before rerunning and now pins
the complete-scorer substitution protocol and unchanged bands.

Clean commit `ad87ac5666701a2b95cefd19603e2960442ae943` ran one exact audit, five warm-up pairs, and
twenty alternating timed pairs over 16 seeds x six rotations x four rounds. All batches reproduced
the audited fingerprint/outcomes and exactly 132,722 successful non-forced MLP evaluations.

**M09-029: ACCEPT width 256.** Median ratio **1.857x**, range **1.849–1.866x**, sample SD
**0.004617**, exit 0. The width-128 fallback is not triggered. Raw samples are in
`plans/evidence/M09-029.md`.

The deferred M09-018 findings are also resolved before exit review: legacy schema-2/3/5 Python
migrations are explicitly unsupported by the project-wide no-Python-parity scope decision, and the
missing heuristic-isolation test now uses non-vacuous probes on both authored scorer/filter
boundaries. M09-030 is dependency-ready and needs its two independent Tier-D passes.

M10-034's first end-to-end PPO driver remains under changes-required review; see
`plans/M10-034_PPO_DRIVER_OPEN_REVIEW_ITEMS.md` for the per-decision return, fail-closed behavior,
persistent Adam, alignment, critic-mode baseline, and retained-checkpoint findings.

## M09-030 Tier-D pass 1: bundle correction pending independent recheck (2026-08-26)

Codex completed one full pass over M09-019..029. Rows 019..027b and 029 have no open pass-1
finding; this pass supplies the written fresh recheck missing from M09-019b's operator closure and
accepts the corrected, non-vacuous M09-027/027b boundary.

M09-028 had a HIGH fail-open manifest boundary: several pinned architecture/runtime/provenance
fields were written but ignored, `update` defaulted to zero, list/checksum inventories were loose,
provenance interpolation could emit invalid JSON, and recovery accepted unreadable manifests.
The correction enforces the exact schema-6 contract and passes bundle **12/0** plus full ti4-mlp
gates. Because Codex implemented that correction, this is a correction submission rather than an
independent acceptance. M09-030 remains open for its independent correction recheck and second
complete Tier-D pass. Existing retained MLP bundles omit the newly enforced compiler field and are
invalid until immutably republished.

Full verdict: `plans/M09-030_TIER_D_PASS1.md`.

## Stage 2 complete-decision planning (2026-09-03)

- Added `plans/STAGE2_COMPLETE_DECISION_CONTRACT.md` as the proposed continuation after
  `STAGE2-OBS-001`.
- Current conclusion: the expanded actor snapshot is necessary but insufficient. The next gate is
  a complete inventory of decision producers and their rule dependencies, followed by typed
  decision/continuation context and option semantics across all consequential heads.
- The plan deliberately retains the current per-option MLP, the engine-owned legal set, and the
  `SeatObservation` hidden-information boundary. Recurrence, a centralized critic, and graph/entity
  architectures are deferred until residual aliasing is measured after the explicit contract.
- First proposed packages: `OBS-002a` decision-producer/delivery audit, then `OBS-002b`
  rule-dependency and aliasing matrix. No Rust implementation or artifact migration is authorized
  by this planning entry.

---

## OBS-002a decision producer/delivery audit (2026-09-03)

- Active branch: `wp/obs-002a-decision-delivery-audit`, based on planning commit `4276188`.
- Added a checked production-source inventory and deterministic full-game decision census.
- Static result: 26 engine modules participate in the decision surface; 15 consequential asks are
  viewless (game 4, invasion 2, laws 1, relics 7, timing 1). None is an approved setup/offline
  exception. No production module calls a decider directly outside `Table`.
- Dynamic result: four deterministic four-round games exercised 3,869 non-forced choices across 18
  heads but reached none of the rare viewless sites. `transit` was absent. This proves ordinary
  rollout coverage cannot replace the static delivery gate.
- Current `Choice` cannot identify a typed source or subtype; the router still falls back to free
  prompt text for six categories. That is now an explicit dependency for OBS-003a.
- Checks currently green: inventory 4/4, engine 1,108 + 3 integration + 5 docs, training 133, and
  strict Clippy on the engine audit target. Strict training Clippy remains blocked by three existing
  unrelated library findings; the package example is clean under a capped run.
- Evidence: `plans/evidence/OBS-002A.md`. Independent Tier-C review APPROVED: the inventory was
  recounted independently and matches exactly, and the gate was proved sensitive by mutation --
  a compiling `.ask(` added inside `tokens.rs`'s production region was caught with the correct
  module, function and classification, then reverted. Two non-blocking notes recorded: the
  "3/3" count is stale (four tests), and the `assert_eq!(count, 15)` is a ratchet over the
  registry constant rather than a direct measurement of the engine.
- ACCEPTED and committed. The deliverables had been left untracked; they are now in the tree with
  the two review notes closed rather than merely recorded. The viewless-count test no longer
  asserts only the registry constant: it also sums the SCANNED AskViewless sites, which was
  proved to measure the engine by adding a sixteenth ask and watching it fail 16 against 15.
  The stale "3/3" is corrected to 4/4, and two strict-Clippy findings were fixed so
  `RUSTFLAGS=-D warnings cargo clippy -p ti4-engine --all-targets` passes clean.
- OBS-002b COMPLETE. Matrix: `plans/evidence/OBS-002B_RULE_DEPENDENCY_MATRIX.md`, mapping all 80
  producers from the OBS-002a registry to the state their legality and application read, and to
  whether that class reaches the observation. Hard findings, ranked: laws/agenda/custodians is read
  by 14 producers and `features.rs` contains ZERO occurrences of `laws` or `custodians`; actor-own
  state is present but lost in the option-crossing (108 of 164 proven aliases); phase-timing carries
  round but not phase, passed or initiative; four stochastic producers have no outcome
  representation. Hidden information: nine producers touch hidden collections and every one is
  actor-scoped or reads the public discard, so no leak was found -- cleared by reading, because the
  automated scope heuristic over-flagged seven of them.
- Next: OBS-003a typed choice-context schema. `Choice` has no typed source or subtype, so the router
  falls back to free prompt text, and the prompt reaches the option-invariant state key in only
  1,753 of 3,678 decisions.
- Superseded note: the empirical half is done and committed --
  `plans/evidence/OBS-002B_ALIASING_CENSUS.md` and the `observation_alias` example -- finding
  164 PROVEN aliases where the engine held a distinction the model never received, 108 of them
  on the `tokens` head. The rule-dependency matrix itself is still to write.

## Operator performance investigation — 2026-09-08

Report: [ENGINE_OPTIMIZATION_2026-09-08.md](ENGINE_OPTIMIZATION_2026-09-08.md).
Corrected candidate-only timing attribution: direct engine time is ~17% of measured rollout,
not 86%. Added `crates/ti4-mlp/examples/engine_cost.rs`; optimized only `supply::held` to reuse
one exact source-scoped catalogue per count. Measured 13.87% engine reduction across 36 unique
games, 15.15% median over five interleaved pairs; estimated 1.4–1.6% total-training saving.
All ordered-choice/event/final-state hashes match before/after and direct/legacy runners.
Final checks: 1,241 engine unit tests and 5 docs pass; profiler test passes; strict engine and
isolated profiler Clippy pass. Full suite remains blocked by the unrelated decision-delivery
inventory mismatch (3 integration tests pass, 1 fails); MLP Clippy has 11 existing library lints.
Other sessions changed combat/space-station/game code during the task; frozen executable and
source-manifest methodology, exclusions, commands and raw logs are in the report. No unrelated
source edited, no staging/commit/branch change. Supply patch independent review remains open.
Next safe action: owner reconciles the delivery registry; rerun full suite and independently
review the small supply change before integration. This investigation does not advance any
migration milestone or approve a policy/observation-surface change.

## Offline BC v2 corpus, training, and evaluation (2026-09-13)

- **Corpus published**: `E:/ti4-corpus/pilot-retained-32k-20260913-v2` (bucketed zstd:
  `good/ bad/ random/`, canonical inclusive ≥6 retention, seed base `1_026_091_500`). No
  `failed/` folder = zero engine failures. The requested **200k run was stopped by the operator
  prematurely at ~game 948**; partial staging remains on E: (`pilot-retained-200k-20260913.staging-*`)
  and is not resumable (capture refuses an existing staging dir) — a clean restart would need it
  deleted. Restart pending operator intent.
- **Model**: `out/offline-bc-v2-20260913-from-318956` trained by codex from the v2 `good + random`
  buckets via `train-raw-parallel` (update 3380, created 22:37).
- **Evaluation** (`crossplay_eval`, vs frozen checkpoint-318956, holdout pool, 60 seeds × 6
  rotations × 6 candidate seats = 2,160 games/direction, log `out/eval-bcv2-vs-ckpt318956.log`):

| faction | games | VP    | margin   | win     | cleared | waste   | offers |
|---------|-------|-------|----------|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| hacan   | 360   | 3.369 | −1.517   | 13.9%   | 85.83%  | 13.89%  | 3.39   |
| jolnar  | 360   | 3.500 | −1.425   | 12.8%   | 48.33%  | 18.89%  | 2.97   |
| l1z1x   | 360   | 3.239 | −1.808   | 8.9%    | 93.06%  | 15.00%  | 2.88   |
| letnev  | 360   | 3.061 | −1.942   | 6.9%    | 81.39%  | 12.50%  | 2.65   |
| sol     | 360   | 3.481 | −1.394   | 11.9%   | 93.33%  | 14.72%  | 2.86   |
| xxcha   | 360   | 2.928 | −2.075   | 6.4%    | 88.89%  | 19.44%  | 2.93   |
| ALL     | 2160  | 3.263 | **−1.694** | **10.1%** | 81.81%  | 15.74%  | 2.95   |

- Reading: the null for this horizon (candidate == benchmark, i.e. checkpoint vs itself) is
  margin ≈ −1.585 / win ≈ 11.4%. BC-v2 at −1.694 / 10.1% sits ~0.1 VP-margin below the teacher's
  self-play null — distillation reproduces roughly teacher-level play, does not exceed it (expected
  for pure behavior cloning). The earlier run-#1 model (`offline-bc-32k-20260913-from-318956`,
  strict >6 corpus) measured −1.587 / 10.8%, essentially at the null; BC-v2 is slightly worse,
  within plausible run-to-run variance but worth a repeat before drawing conclusions. Per-faction:
  xxcha weakest (win 6.4%), jolnar's cleared rate (48.3%) is an outlier vs ~81–93% elsewhere —
  more horizon cutoffs when the candidate plays Jol-Nar.

## Single-checkpoint capture mode added (2026-09-14)

`capture_offline_pilot` gained `--single <checkpoint-dir>` + `--temperatures t1,t2,...`
(default 0.25,1.0,2.5) so a run can use one checkpoint at several temperatures for every seat
instead of the mixed 11-kind cycle. Requested target:
`out/vponly-main-20260911/checkpoints/checkpoint-236464`. Determinism verified byte-identical
across worker counts; per-seat audit confirms only the requested checkpoint is used.
Evidence: `plans/evidence/OFFLINE_PILOT_SINGLE_CHECKPOINT.md`; launch script
`out/launch_single_ckpt_run.ps1` ready, run pending operator's game count / go-ahead.

## Reviewer app (ti4-review) unblocked by LEADER-FIX-001 follow-up (2026-09-14)

The operator's game-inspection app panicked after the leader fix (`features.rs:2838`, i32
overflow). Root cause and fix as recorded in `plans/evidence/LEADER_FIX_001.md` under
"Reviewer-app fix follow-up": bounded sentinel `UNLIMITED_FLEET_BILL = 10_000` replaces the
unbounded `i64::MAX` fleet bill for Letnev's unlimited round, at the single choke point in
`fleet.rs`. Verified end-to-end through `ti4-review simulate --until end` on four seeds where
the hero is actually used (flag active rounds 5–7); all completed. The app is usable again;
its pre-existing 1 GiB session save limit can still reject very long games (observed on seed
102, which terminates normally).

## Partial publish of killed capture runs + single-ckpt training launcher (2026-09-14)

`capture_offline_pilot` gained `--publish-staging <dir> [--out] --checkpoint --games N
[--workers N]`: it decodes/validates every staged per-game part, excludes truncated kill
artifacts with a report (refusing on decodable-but-inconsistent data), reconstructs outcomes,
and assembles a fully valid corpus (root + scoped manifests, retention sidecar, byte-exactness
gates) from whatever complete games exist. `Manifest.workers` became `Option<usize>`; normal
run path unchanged (`keep_parts = false`). 18/18 example tests incl. truncation/corruption/
publish cases; clippy clean for new code; real-data regression (20 games → published 13/20)
and newline-count validation on real shards passed. Evidence:
`plans/evidence/OFFLINE_PILOT_PARTIAL_PUBLISH.md`. Launcher `out/train_single_ckpt.ps1`
(gitignored): kill capture → rebuild release binary → publish staging to
`E:\ti4-corpus\vponly-single-236464-20260914-partial` → rebuild CUDA `offline_bc` →
`train-raw-parallel` on good+random (v2 recipe) into `out/offline-bc-single-<date>-from-236464`.

Working-tree note: four unrelated example files (`fracture_census.rs`,
`objective_signal_audit.rs`, `rng_probe.rs`, `route_conversion.rs`) carry pre-existing
formatting-only drift from an earlier whole-crate fmt; left uncommitted, out of scope.

**Run status (2026-09-14):** the operator killed the 332k single-checkpoint capture with a
BREAK event (`forrtl: error (200)` in `out/run-single-ckpt.log`). At kill time **158,755 /
332,768 games had completed** (~48%). Staging is intact at
`E:\ti4-corpus\vponly-single-236464-20260914.staging-59548`. Next action: run
`out/train_single_ckpt.ps1` (rebuilds release capture, publishes staging to
`...-partial`, rebuilds CUDA offline_bc, trains good+random). Part counts/sizes not yet
tallied; a few parts may be truncated by the kill and will be excluded with a report.

### Recovery review correction and authorized continuation

The earlier partial-publish description above is superseded by the hardened recovery boundary in
the next commit. It fully deserializes every decision, checks game/seat/faction/policy identity and
loss alignment, rejects duplicate indices and checkpoint-digest conflicts, validates the pinned
map-pool digest, and records actual (`158,755`) and planned (`332,768`) game counts separately.
Generation commit/dirty state/binary SHA are distinct from the publisher commit. Recovery uses the
requested 32-thread Rayon pool and builds in a sibling directory before atomic rename; the original
staging remains untouched and retryable. Future single-checkpoint runs rotate temperatures across
seats. Focused verification is 20/20 tests; strict Clippy is blocked only by existing unrelated
library warnings listed in `plans/evidence/OFFLINE_PILOT_PARTIAL_PUBLISH.md`.

The authoritative committed launcher is now `scripts/publish_and_train_stopped_corpus.ps1`. After
publication it trains the `good + random` buckets for five epochs on CUDA with 32 parser workers,
initialized from `out/offline-bc-v2-20260913-from-318956`. The output is experimental because this
corpus predates the leader fix and retains the historical seat/temperature confound; it requires
evaluation before promotion.

### Astra advisory review — 2026-09-16

- Completed the review requested in `plans/ASTRA_REVIEW_REQUEST_2026-09-16.md`.
- Response and source evidence: `plans/ASTRA_REVIEW_RESPONSE_2026-09-16.md`.
- Reviewed branch `codex/diplomacy-v1`, HEAD `85d01517a196315a5062b706199513c7570f15c0`,
  with existing uncommitted work preserved. Advisory documentation only; no code changes,
  commits, training runs, benchmarks, or new test results. This does not close the pending
  full Tier-C legality/schema review.
- Key corrections: PPO games already execute through Rayon despite the stale sequential footer;
  no-offer contacts do not prove empty menus; crossplay wins are strict horizon VP leadership;
  the Fracture census uses an audit helper that can return partial state after errors/step caps.
- Next recommended work: collect the training-regime contact funnel and existing performance
  diagnostics, correct census completion reporting, then compare explicitly configured VP-focused
  pilots and paired round-4 evaluations. Implementation remains proposed, not completed.
- Operator clarification: do not extend beyond four rounds. Maximizing VP by the end of round 4
  is the intended playing-to-win objective. The review's earlier longer-horizon recommendation
  is withdrawn; Fracture opportunities must be assessed by their payoff within four rounds.
- Verification: `git diff --check` passed; scoped tracked and new-file whitespace checks also
  passed for the review documentation. Tree remains intentionally dirty.

### GPU inference smoke — 2026-09-16

- User authorized a GPU simulation smoke test. Added only the diagnostic example
  `crates/ti4-mlp/examples/gpu_inference_smoke.rs`, evidence
  `plans/evidence/GPU_INFERENCE_SMOKE_2026-09-16.md`, and this state entry. Existing dirty
  implementation preserved; production PPO remains unchanged, no commits or training runs.
- Four rounds fixed; one real CPU game and one unbatched CUDA game, plus identical-input
  actor/critic replay at batch sizes 1/8/32. Checkpoint 212544, held-out pool, diplomacy on,
  temperature 2.5, seed 1261600101. RTX 3090 and existing CUDA libtorch.
- Final smoke passed: 2,649 decisions per game; final-state/event hashes match. CPU game 2.62 s,
  unbatched GPU game 4.47 s. Median batch-32 GPU replay 19,462 decisions/s versus 3,435 for
  ordinary single-thread CPU scoring and 6,057 for CPU batch 32. These exclude engine/features
  and do not compare against the parallel CPU worker pool; no training speedup is established.
- Numerical probability/critic tolerances pass, but 7/512 greedy choices differ in the mixed
  batch paths. Common-draw sampled choices in the replay did not change. Production integration
  needs numerical/behavioral qualification; the smoke is not a bitwise-parity gate.
- Release build, two regression tests, CLI bounds checks, rustfmt and whitespace checks passed.
  Global strict Clippy hits 17 pre-existing library warnings; scoped Clippy passed with warnings
  denied inside the new example. All owned test/build processes exited; no background run remains.
- Next useful experiment: live cross-game batched inference service with bounded queue/flush,
  compared against existing parallel CPU rollouts at the same four-round workload. Not implemented
  or promoted by this smoke. Reproduction command and raw-result hashes are in the evidence.

### Live GPU rollout disposition and combat-arena assessment — 2026-09-16

- User requested a minimally briefed Terra agent and measured PPO update throughput;
  later requested evaluating whether continued GPU work was worthwhile, with combat
  arena learning as an alternative. Four-round limit remains fixed.
- Two 96-game, 32-worker CPU updates took 36.415/36.272 s; two GPU batch-32 updates
  took 82.508/83.458 s. GPU averaged 2.283 times the update duration. Stop this tuning
  branch; retain CPU rollouts and CUDA optimization. No GPU speedup established.
- CPU repetitions match all 96 state/event/choice digests. GPU runs differ on a few
  trajectories and from each other. Experimental GPU path is not qualified for
  deterministic production training. Three service tests passed as reported by
  Terra; full final qualification and exact command manifest were interrupted by
  its usage limit. Parent independently verified raw logs and hashes.
- Evidence and concrete arena feasibility/transfer gates:
  `plans/evidence/GPU_BATCHED_ROLLOUT_EXPERIMENT_2026-09-16.md`.
- Other concurrent work committed the experimental code in `ae3980f`; parent found
  clean branch `codex/diplomacy-v1` at `740dc82` before adding these two documentation
  changes. This task made no commits and did not alter those subsequent source edits.
- No owned trainer/build remained at inspection. No additional GPU runs or arena
  training were started. Next useful step is an engine-backed combat-label pilot,
  gated by actor-input sufficiency and eventual round-4 VP transfer, not an assumed
  improvement from battle prediction alone.

### Battle-arena plan and adjacent mechanics — 2026-09-16

- Operator requested a battle-arena plan and other applicable areas of play.
- Added `plans/BATTLE_ARENA_PLAN_2026-09-16.md`: input/coverage audit, bounded
  engine-backed labels, held-out outcome prediction, explicit policy integration,
  then equal-total-time round-4 VP transfer. Separate prediction, combat decisions
  and strategic attack selection; do not replace the VP critic or PPO reward.
- Proposed first unit ARENA-001 is audit plus 4,096-fight smoke, with a five-minute
  runtime cap. Larger label generation, training and integration are gated future
  work; none were executed in this planning turn.
- Other candidates prioritized: objective/payment puzzles, movement/cargo, invasion;
  then production and token planning. Diplomacy/agenda subgames are later because
  value depends strongly on hidden intent and subsequent opponent behavior.
- All full-game generation and evaluation stays capped at four game rounds.
  Existing engine combat-round bounds are separate from that game horizon.
- This turn changes documentation only; no source edits, training, commits or
  checkpoint promotion. Existing GPU evidence changes remain preserved.

### Battle-arena integration design — 2026-09-16

- Operator requested starting the design with explicit main-model integration.
  Added `plans/BATTLE_ARENA_DESIGN_2026-09-16.md` and linked it from the plan.
- Chosen initial design: frozen small combat predictor packaged with the policy;
  option-specific factual/predicted battle features enter the existing sparse MLP.
  PPO learns strategic use from round-4 VP; no battle reward or VP-critic replacement.
- First live surface is incremental movement including done_moving. Activation is
  deferred until a legal concrete commitment can be described. Already committed
  ships, candidate ship/cargo, private-information independence and unsupported
  mechanics are explicit input/coverage contracts.
- Design covers typed crate boundaries, engine labels, conditional continuation
  semantics, materialized PPO inputs, predictor freezing, migration/resume, CPU-local
  inference and concrete acceptance fixtures. No unconditional combat odds claim.
- ARENA-001 remains the first implementation: typed contract/input audit and bounded
  engine generator. No predictor, runtime integration, dataset or training run was
  implemented in this design turn. Architecture review is pending; no commits made.

### Pitched-battle clarification and agent handoff — 2026-09-16

- User clarified isolated pitched battles with varied compositions, upgrades and
  factions, optionally random action cards, with only combat decisions remaining.
- Added `plans/BATTLE_ARENA_AGENT_HANDOFF_2026-09-16.md` as the authoritative entry
  point for a different agent. Linked supersession notices in both older documents.
- Earlier ordinary-fleet/20-input scope is only a smoke baseline. Build the arena
  before downstream movement integration; include tested faction/upgrade coverage
  and explicit timing support for any later action-card experiments.
- Handoff supplies the first bounded task, contracts, integration boundary, tests,
  resource limits and current status. Documentation only; no arena implementation,
  training or commits performed.

### ARENA-001 probe — 2026-09-16

- First executable unit of `plans/BATTLE_ARENA_AGENT_HANDOFF_2026-09-16.md`. Evidence:
  `plans/evidence/ARENA_001_PROBE_2026-09-16.md`.
- New `crates/ti4-training/examples/battle_arena_probe.rs`, **uncommitted**: the handoff requests no
  commits for this task. No dataset, predictor, PPO, vocabulary or checkpoint change.
- Drives the real engine through the public `combat::resolve`. `CombatWindow::pending_choice` and
  `resolve` are private to `ti4-engine`, so the stepped driver is not reachable from `ti4-training`.
  Limitation recorded: `combat::resolve` consumes the scoring pause internally, so a pause cannot be
  reported as a failure by this probe.
- Gates met on one matchup, 32 dice seeds per policy: zero failures, zero contaminated positions
  (`intruders` 0 throughout, so `start_game` home fleets do not leak in), seed 0 reproducible
  including survivor counts, ~2,100 fights/second single-threaded.
- Policy sensitivity demonstrated: changing only the casualty rule moved attacker wins 7 to 9,
  added 3 mutual destructions, and changed surviving damaged dreadnoughts 1 to 9 against cruisers
  49 to 36. Labels are outcomes under a named continuation policy, not combat odds.
- Two corrections to claims made earlier in the session, both the assistant's: the casualty rule
  moved the win rate modestly rather than sharply, and the flat "mean rounds 3.00" was coincidence
  (rounds spread 1 to 5 under both policies; `MAX_ROUNDS` 50 was never approached).
- Next exact step: scenario schema with split families assigned before dice repetitions, then
  128 scenarios x 32 seeds with a failure ledger and fights/second, including at least one upgrade
  and one faction-specific combat effect in that first report.

### ARENA-001 scenario generator and first labelled corpus — 2026-09-16

- Second pass over `plans/BATTLE_ARENA_AGENT_HANDOFF_2026-09-16.md`. Evidence:
  `plans/evidence/ARENA_001_PROBE_2026-09-16.md`, which **replaces** the earlier probe report of the
  same name (its results table, throughput figure and "not done" list are superseded).
- `crates/ti4-training/examples/battle_arena_probe.rs` remains **uncommitted**: the handoff requests
  no commits for this task. No predictor, PPO, vocabulary or checkpoint change.
- Generator enumerates legal fleets per profile with a profile-dependent capacity check, plays both
  role assignments, and groups by order-independent `family()` so a matchup and its mirror share a
  split. Runs across all cores via `par_chunks`, merged in chunk order.
- Throughput 1,344 -> 9,705 -> 17,740 fights/s (single-threaded; 32 workers; 32 workers with
  `fixtures::game()` and `plain_systems()` hoisted to one `GameState` per worker, cloned per fight).
  13.2x overall, ~13x on 32 workers rather than 32x; residual serial cost not isolated.
- Correctness across both rewrites: cap 3 reproduced 75,325 / 77,172 / 2,071 and cap 2 with four
  factions reproduced 692,762 / 705,957 / 25,953, identical before and after. Zero contaminated
  positions and zero failures across ~2.5M fights.
- Upgrade and faction coverage delivered in the first report via a cap-2 panel over Hacan, Sol,
  Sardakk and Jol-Nar, each with and without upgrades, as the handoff requires.
- First labelled corpus emitted behind `--emit` (absent the flag the probe only reports): cap 3,
  64 seeds, 19,321 rows from 1,236,544 fights in 69.7s. Label is three rates -- attacker, defender,
  mutual -- summing to 1, verified 0 violations; a single attacker rate could not distinguish a
  defender win from mutual destruction. Split is deterministic FNV-1a over `family()`, verified
  **0 families spanning more than one split**. Manifest records the casualty policy, seed panel and
  caveats.
- Two corpus properties recorded for any consumer: 34.6% of rows are foregone conclusions (label
  stdev 0.406, bimodal), so evaluation must be stratified by contestedness or the easy rows dominate
  the score; and uniform enumeration does not match play frequencies, which matters because the
  design freezes this predictor into the actor's input layer.
- Limitation unchanged: `combat::resolve` consumes the scoring pause internally, so a pause cannot be
  reported as a failure by this probe.
- Six further corrections to assistant claims recorded in the evidence document: sizing ~3x low; a
  false mirror diagnosis; the defender "landslide" as an artefact of canonical ordering (58,010 to
  18,839, versus 75,325 to 77,172 once both orderings are played); "attacker fires first" wrong, fire
  is simultaneous under LRR 78.6; throughput twice reported from a stale binary after `link.exe` 1104
  failures, with cap-6 runtime estimated 27 minutes then ~2.0 hours then ~64 minutes; and mutual
  destruction overstated from one symmetric duel (corpus mean 0.0116).
- The design document's typed contract (`ArenaScenarioV1`, `ArenaOutcomeV1`, `BattleFeatureEmitter`)
  does not exist in code; the probe emits JSONL directly. Corpus lives in the session scratchpad; no
  home chosen inside the repository.
- Next exact step: decide where a corpus belongs in the repository, then either reweight toward
  played positions or train a first predictor on the contested stratum, reporting calibration
  separately for contested and foregone rows.

### ARENA-002 lean simulator, predictor and battle facts — 2026-09-17

- Evidence: `plans/evidence/ARENA_002_PREDICTOR_2026-09-17.md`. User overrode the design's
  engine-only labelling rule; the design doc carries the note.
- `ti4-training::battle_arena`: two-fleet simulator (six factions +/- upgrades, war suns,
  flagships and their Jol-Nar/Letnev/L1Z1X effects, Hacan at 0 trade goods, both sides' space
  cannon, starting damage, supply limits). Matches the engine with effects off (0.36pp mean gap)
  and ti4calc with effects on (0.2pp, 0 of 300 beyond |z| 3).
- `battle_predictor` trains straight from it (no stored corpus): 0.43pp held-out MAE, 1.15pp on
  contested fights, in ~3.5 minutes. Exported to `ti4_policy::battle::BattlePredictor`.
- Live play: movement options carry `action-plan:battle-*` facts; bundle schema 11/12 (ABI 4)
  carries the predictor. `checkpoint-212544-arena-v1` migrated from 212544, identical play,
  +1.4% wall time.
- Queued engine fixes (need ti4-sim): attacker space cannon offense; Jol-Nar, Letnev, L1Z1X
  flagship abilities.
- Next: `scripts/arena_pilot.psd1`, the VP-only pilot mirrored with the arena learner;
  `checkpoint-10456` is the no-arena control.

### Engine: attacker space cannon and three flagships — 2026-09-17

- `b3c5702`: space cannon offense includes the active player's guns (user ruling, as ti4calc);
  J.N.S. Hylarim, Arc Secundus and 0.0.1 implemented. Engine now matches the arena's lean
  simulator with flagship effects on (0.37pp mean gap, 400 scenarios x 2000).
- `e551018`: ti4-sim behaviour bounds re-baselined to v39 with user approval. Only the space
  cannon rule moves the batch (score_spread, vp_pace); recorded in `plans/evidence/M08-021.md`.
  ti4-sim 51/52; the remaining failure is the pool file missing from this worktree.
- The arena pilot running since c02a49f uses the engine from before these fixes, as does its
  control; later runs get the fixed engine.

### ARENA battle features v2: guns and survivors — 2026-09-17

- Guns (PDS, PDS II, Xxcha mech, reaching guns) and guns-only defenders in the lean simulator,
  encoding and live query; survival outputs and cost-lost facts. Checked against ti4calc.
- Predictor v2: 0.41pp win MAE, 0.74pp survival MAE. `checkpoint-212544-arena-v2` migrated,
  identical play. Version 1 bundles unchanged in behaviour.
- Next by user order: ground combat, then retreat. Evidence: ARENA_002_PREDICTOR_2026-09-17.md.

### ARENA ground combat and predictor v3 — 2026-09-17

- Engine ground fixes `d573e7a`; ti4-sim v40 `ebb5fbf` (51/52, pool-file env failure only).
- Lean ground simulator checked against ti4calc (0.19pp) and the fixed engine (0.36pp).
- Predictor v3 adds a ground network and invasion facts on commit options;
  `checkpoint-212544-arena-v3` migrated, identical play. Evidence in
  `plans/evidence/ARENA_002_PREDICTOR_2026-09-17.md`.
- Next: retreat; action cards last. The arena PPO pilot (v1) still awaits evaluation.

### ARENA retreat: engine round order and predictor v4 — 2026-09-17

- `a6524a6` announces retreats after the round-1 barrage; ti4-sim v41 `0bc379e`.
- Predictor v4: fights under way and staying-in facts on retreat announcements;
  `checkpoint-212544-arena-v4`, identical play. Remaining: action cards; the arena PPO pilot
  still awaits evaluation, and nothing has trained with v2-v4 yet.

## 2026-09-17 — arena v1 pilot result; v4 pilot pair launched

- Eval vs champion (20 blocks, 4 rounds, fixed engine): control 10456 VP 3.34 / margin −1.39 /
  cleared 89.3%; arena v1 pilot 9480 VP 2.98 / margin −1.78 / cleared 76.8%. The v1 pilot lost.
  Both were trained on the pre-fix engine.
- Launched `scripts/arena_v4_pilot.psd1` (learner checkpoint-212544-arena-v4), then
  `scripts/vp_v4_control.psd1` (plain 212544), same seeds, fixed engine, commit 44f130b.
- Reviewer now scores MLP traces with arena battle facts (they were missing).

## 2026-09-17 — Astra activation-rework advisory review

- Reviewed `plans/ASTRA_ACTIVATION_REWORK_2026-09-17.md` and relevant code at
  `7b22aff81284d0d2a9abad317f47a665be8d7899`. Opinion and concrete conditions in
  `plans/ASTRA_ACTIVATION_REWORK_RESPONSE_2026-09-17.md`.
- Supports preactivation candidate-fleet information and a bounded macro-policy
  pilot, but not the three fixed templates as the only action space. Recommends
  diverse candidates/manual branch, joint movement-resource feasibility, explicit
  plan invalidation and correct package likelihood recording; retain adaptive
  landings initially and compare against an information-only activation control.
- Index is a shortlist heuristic; opening-adjusted strength depends on the enemy.
  Probe favorite accuracy excludes close matches. Require shortlist recall/regret
  before fitting more weights. Current invasion query is post-bombardment; separate
  conditional odds from whole-action capture probability.
- Additional source finding: lean arena's 50-round cap shares `winner: None` with
  mutual destruction. Require explicit unresolved labels and an incidence count;
  no claim made about frequency in existing datasets.
- Review only: no engine/code fixes, replay, calibration rerun, training or commits.
  Does not qualify the proposed implementation or independently reproduce reported
  figures. Accepted lean-simulator user override and four-round objective preserved.

## 2026-09-17 — activation rework, phases 0–5

- Restore point `restore/pre-activation-rework-2026-09-17` (e392835).
- Engine: carried mechs no longer sustain space hits; start-of-combat-round cards are for the two
  combatants; Ceasefire denies movement for the whole activation (this was the repeated reviewer
  frames). ti4-sim re-baselined to v42.
- `ti4-policy::fleet_strength` and `ti4-policy::tactical_plan`: candidate fleets per destination,
  jointly feasible, priced by the arena predictor; `package_legality` gate passes with 0 failures.
- Fact versions 5 (ground forces vs structures), 6 (candidate summaries on activations) and 7 (the
  bot samples the fleet and a plan carries it out). Bundles: checkpoint-212544-arena-v5/-v6/-v7.
- Pilots at 50 updates each: arm A (information) wins on VP 3.43 / margin −1.28; arm 0 3.15 /
  −1.66; arm B (packages) 2.74 / −1.98. Evidence in plans/evidence/ACTIVATION_REWORK_2026-09-17.md.

## 2026-09-18 — R02 replayer starts: two decisions, R02-001 committed awaiting review

- Reviewed `plans/R02_REPLAYER.md` against the code before implementing. Two operator decisions now
  bind every R02 package, and they are **not** written into that plan file, whose text still
  contradicts them in four places (listed in `plans/evidence/R02-001.md`):
  1. **`crates/ti4-engine` is frozen.** No engine edits for any R02 package, including the
     "one narrow engine invariant test" R02-004 had allowed itself, and no
     `Game::legal_options()` change.
  2. **Nested choices may be presented inside one engine-step window**, so pausing must work at
     every decision rather than only at step boundaries.
- Consequence: **one simulation thread owns `LiveReview`/`Game`**, and the R02 decider parks on a
  rendezvous with the UI. `Game` never crosses the thread. Abort-and-retry is impossible: `Game` is
  not `Clone` and its open windows, `prepared_turn_seq`, `event_sequence` and `galaxy` live on
  `Game`, not in `GameState`, so a step cannot be undone and a saved frame cannot be resumed.
  `Game::legal_options()` is a hint only — it never sees the open transaction window.
- Measured from `out/reviews/pruned-diplomacy-seed11-t05.ti4review.json` (read-only): **670 settled
  decisions across 602 engine steps; 37 steps (6.1%) settled more than one, maximum 8.** The plan's
  "one engine step consumes at most one generated choice" invariant is false as written. Frame cost
  is 115–183 KB of plain JSON, against a 1 GiB plain-session bound, so 128 branch-frames per project
  cannot all carry state snapshots — open question for R02-005.
- **R02-001 implemented, verified and committed** on `wp/r02-001-control-primitives` (subject
  "R02-001 replayer choice identity and control primitives"): new lib-only crate
  `crates/ti4-replayer` (`control.rs`: seat modes keyed by physical `PlayerId`,
  `PendingManualChoice` with `frame` + `ask`, versioned length-prefixed `ChoiceFingerprint`, typed
  submission outcomes where every refusal preserves the pending choice, `ReplayRecord`,
  `Provenance`, 128-branch and 1024-option bounds) plus the workspace member entry and its 12-line
  `Cargo.lock` entry (no new external crate).
  Gate: `cargo fmt -p ti4-replayer -- --check` clean; `cargo test -p ti4-replayer` **13 passed,
  0 failed**; `cargo clippy -p ti4-replayer --all-targets --no-deps -- -D warnings` exit 0. `--no-deps` is
  needed because a trailing `-D warnings` also denies the 14 **pre-existing** warnings in
  `ti4-model`/`ti4-engine`; with dependencies included none of them are in `crates/ti4-replayer`.
  R01 measured unchanged: `cargo check -p ti4-review --lib` clean, `cargo test -p ti4-review`
  **33 passed, 0 failed**.
- **Review requirements are waived for R02.** Operator, 2026-09-18: "keep advancing the plan, I am
  explicitly waiving the review requirements. compact now and after each work package. keep going
  until you are done or really need help/input". This supersedes, for R02 only, both the independent
  local-model review tier and R02-004's Tier-C/frontier review, and the "one package then stop for
  review" cadence: work continues package to package, with `plans/EXECUTION_STATE.md` and the package
  evidence written and a `/compact` requested at every package boundary. No review has been performed
  on R02-001 and none is claimed; the compensating control is test evidence per package.
- Working tree: branched from `codex/fix-six-faction-leaders` at `0586b92`. The operator's unrelated
  uncommitted edits (`crates/ti4-mlp/examples/capture_offline_pilot.rs`,
  `crates/ti4-mlp/examples/offline_bc.rs`, `plans/INDEX.md`,
  `scripts/publish_and_train_stopped_corpus.ps1`) were deliberately left unstaged and untouched, and
  so were `plans/R02_REPLAYER.md` (the operator's own plan document, still untracked) and
  `target-cuda-repack/`.
- Verify command for R02-001 if it ever needs re-running:
  `cargo fmt -p ti4-replayer -- --check && cargo test -p ti4-replayer && cargo clippy -p ti4-replayer --all-targets --no-deps -- -D warnings`.

## Next package to execute: R02-002 — additive controlled-decider injection

```text
ID and title        R02-002 — additive controlled-decider injection (plans/R02_REPLAYER.md)
Milestone/deps      R02 program; R02-001 done (branch wp/r02-001-control-primitives @ 31445af)
Objective           Let R02 wrap each seat's real policy in a ControlledDecider *under* the trace
                    wrapper, while LiveReview::start keeps producing byte-identical behaviour.
Normative sources   plans/R02_REPLAYER.md "Component contracts" (ControlledDecider paragraph) and
                    "R02-002"; plans/R01_REVIEW_VIEWER.md for what must not change; engine is frozen.
Acceptance tests    default vs identity-hook: identical manifest, frames, events, decisions, scores
                    and outcome; one override traces normally; other seats unchanged.
Allowed Rust edits  crates/ti4-review/src/lib.rs; crates/ti4-replayer/src/{lib.rs,control.rs,
                    decider.rs}; tests in both crates. NO edits to crates/ti4-engine/**.
Permission          P1. No network, no processes, no artifacts, no external state.
Inputs              a schema-6 bundle + a map pool, both already on disk (see R01 settings paths).
Outputs             R01 seam `LiveReview::start_with_control(config, hook)`; `ControlledDecider` in
                    ti4-replayer; R01 semantic golden fixture(s) frozen BEFORE the seam.
Invariants          trace wrapper stays outermost, so a human choice still carries the policy's own
                    scores/probabilities; linear (LearnedBot/TraceBot) and MLP (MlpBot/MlpTraceBot)
                    paths both wrap; no session-schema change; R01 CLI/HTML/GUI untouched.
Non-goals           no stepping, no pausing, no persistence, no GUI, no branch tree, no R02-006 view
                    extraction. Do not touch gui.rs in this package.
Tests to add        R01: golden-comparison test (default path vs identity hook) over a fixed
                    seed/rotation/bundle/pool at a bounded step count; hook called once per seat in
                    setup order. R02: ControlledDecider answers from inner when Auto; answers a queued
                    Manual id through the engine's own Table validation; one-shot delegation records
                    DelegatedToPolicy; inner is invoked exactly once per ask in every mode; the
                    wrapped decider's consider()/profile() passthrough returns what the inner bot
                    returns so scores are unchanged.
Commands            cargo fmt -p ti4-review -p ti4-replayer && cargo test -p ti4-review -p
                    ti4-replayer && cargo clippy -p ti4-review -p ti4-replayer --all-targets
                    --no-deps -- -D warnings && cargo test -p ti4-training
Evidence            plans/evidence/R02-002.md with the golden's command, seed, bundle and hashes.
Known traps         (1) crates/ti4-review/src/lib.rs:761 is `LiveReview::start`, not `new`; the
                    factory closure builds a BTreeMap<PlayerId, Box<dyn Decider>> from
                    setup_game_with_capabilities_and_decider_factory. (2) `TraceBot.inner` is a
                    concrete `LearnedBot` whose choose_seeing calls inner.consider()/profile()/
                    score_vector() directly — generalising it needs a small pass-through trait, and
                    that is the one risky edit in the package. (3) `MlpBot::seat()` already returns a
                    Box<dyn Decider> inner, so the MLP side is easier. (4) R01's decision trace mixes
                    synthetic rows (`fleet decision`, `plan stopped`, ids `package|N`): never treat
                    those as engine answers. (5) `-D warnings` propagates into path dependencies: 14
                    warnings are pre-existing in ti4-model/ti4-engine, hence --no-deps.
Definition of done  golden frozen and passing before/after the seam; both crates' suites green;
                    strict clippy clean on both; evidence written; one focused commit; handover
                    updated; /compact requested.
```

Defaults taken for the four questions the operator left open (proceed-without-input instruction;
reverse any of these if they later disagree):

1. **R02-005 frame/bounds:** branch frames are compact (engine step, ask/answer, provenance,
   fingerprint) and full state snapshots are kept only for the live branch plus a bounded viewed
   window; the 1,000,001-frame and 1 GiB bounds are enforced **per project across all branches**,
   reported as exhaustion rather than silently trimmed.
2. **Authoritative replay source:** the R02 project persists its own slices of `Game::table.log`
   (`ReplayRecord`), and R01-import branching is best-effort from filtered `DecisionDetail` rows with
   the limitation stated in the file format and in evidence.
3. **R01 import:** the operator re-picks checkpoint and map pool in R02 and the manifest hashes are
   verified; an `engine_commit` or `content_sha256` mismatch **refuses Play up front** with a typed
   diagnostic instead of surfacing as mid-rebuild divergence.
4. **Pre-R02 R01 semantic golden:** created and frozen by R02-002 as its first commit (R02-008
   assumes it exists).

## 2026-09-18 R02-002 additive controlled-decider injection: implemented, all gates green

Evidence: `plans/evidence/R02-002.md`. Branch `wp/r02-002-controlled-decider`.

- `LiveReview::start_with_control(config, hook)` applies
  `PolicyHook = &dyn Fn(&PlayerId, Box<dyn Decider>) -> Box<dyn Decider>` once per seat on the
  simulation thread where deciders are constructed; `start(config)` is that call with the identity
  hook. The hook's output is wrapped by `TraceBot`/`MlpTraceBot`, so a human answer keeps the
  policy's scores, probabilities and feature projections. No session-schema change; CLI/HTML/GUI
  untouched.
- `TraceBot` now holds `Box<dyn Decider>` + `Arc<Profile>` and scores through the new free
  `ti4_policy::consider(profile, seen, choice, held)`, with `LearnedBot::consider` left as a delegate.
  This was forced, not stylistic: `consider` returned `TrueSkillSignal`, whose fields are private and
  which has no public constructor, so a caller outside `ti4-policy` cannot name the old return type.
  `MlpTraceBot` already held `Box<dyn Decider>`; only hook application changed there.
- `crates/ti4-replayer/src/decider.rs`: `ControlledDecider` plus `ManualInbox`, `AnswerLog` /
  `AnsweredDecision`, `ManualFallbacks`. Auto delegates; a queued answer matching the offer's
  `ChoiceFingerprint` is returned without consulting the policy; one-shot delegation records
  `DelegatedToPolicy`; a stale answer is dropped and counted; a manual ask with nothing queued falls
  back to the policy **counted** and `debug_assert`ed, because `IllegalChoice` is frozen and inventing
  a refusal would poison the step.
- Golden `crates/ti4-review/tests/semantic_golden.rs` + fixture
  `crates/ti4-review/tests/golden/pre-r02-mlp-seed7777-rotation2.json` (1,033,808 bytes, sha256
  `f727372e3ea8c426fe42fefad03a33ae54c0f13849217ebc580a13de27ae313b`): committed
  `examples/reviewer/checkpoint-473312/slots.json` + `full_np8_12_holdout.json`, seed 7777, rotation
  2, temperature 0.5, `ProfileTable::Learner`, 240 steps, **no skip path**. Projection = manifest
  (digests, seed/tile seed, rotation, profile table, temperature, diplomacy, factions, initial
  speaker, map arrangement, full policy identity) + every frame (index/engine step/turn/round/phase,
  active players, viewpoint, plan status, event digests, and its decisions with prompt, ordered
  offered options, chosen id, path, scores, probabilities) + outcome. Three tests: default path vs
  golden; identity hook equals the default path and reports the first differing frame; an override
  below the trace answers every real seat0 decision while every offered option keeps the policy's
  score and probability, inner consulted zero times, no engine error.
- Independent second proof: pre-seam vs post-seam `ti4-cli simulate` sessions are **byte-identical**
  after removing the path/commit fields, on BOTH the committed example bundle and the real
  `checkpoint-212544-arena-v7` (241 frames; 295 and 313 real decisions; 0 differing frames).
- Gates: per-package fmt clean; `ti4-replayer` 19 passed; `ti4-review` 33 unit + 3 golden; `ti4-policy`
  266; clippy on both crates `--no-deps -D warnings` exit 0; `cargo check --workspace --all-targets`
  exit 0. `cargo fmt --all --check` reports pre-existing diffs in the operator's uncommitted
  `crates/ti4-mlp/examples/*` - never reformat those; `ti4-policy` clippy's only warnings are
  pre-existing ones in `battle.rs`/`projection.rs`.
- Deviations recorded in evidence: counted fallback instead of an impossible engine error; hook keys
  on `PlayerId` because `ReviewSeat` does not exist in R01; the subtractive alternative (caller-built
  tracing) was rejected because the live trace wrapper produces frames during play;
  `ControlledDecider::choose_seeing` cannot be unit-constructed (`SeatObservation::bind` is
  `pub(crate)`), so both `Decider` methods share one private `decide()` and the bound path gets its
  engine-driven test in R02-003.

## 2026-09-18 R02-003 manual live controller: implemented, all gates green

Evidence: `plans/evidence/R02-003.md`. Branch `wp/r02-003-manual-live-controller`.

- `crates/ti4-replayer/src/live.rs`: `LiveBranch` (one thread owning `LiveReview`; `start`,
  `with_gate`, `try_event`, `event`, `drain_events`, `wait_until_parked`, `wait_until_idle`,
  `into_session`; `Drop` asks the thread to unwind and never joins) and `Gate` (one mutex + two
  condvars holding `ManualControl`, the answer for the pending offer, the goal, the pause flag, the
  lifecycle state and the defensive counters).
- **The plan's mechanism was rejected on measurement, and the measurement is in the evidence.** With
  every seat Manual on the committed bundle: 120 engine steps -> 158 asks (17 steps raised >=2, worst
  frame 7 asks); 400 steps -> 506 asks (52 steps raised >=2, worst frame 10). `legal_options()`
  cannot see any of those (it never inspects `Game::trade`; 116 ask sites in 22 modules), so the
  pause is taken inside `Table::ask` and answered from the UI thread. Exactly one thread ever touches
  `Game`; abort-and-retry remains rejected (`Game` is not `Clone`).
- `ti4-review` was NOT modified in this package; only the R02-002 seam is used. No engine file
  changed.
- Deadlock-freedom: the only sim->UI channel is `sync_channel(MAX_QUEUED_EVENTS = 4096)` written with
  `try_send`; a full queue counts `Gate::dropped_events` (measured 0) instead of blocking. Commands
  are direct gate calls returning synchronously, so nothing the UI waits on is behind that channel.
- `LiveReview` is not `Send` (`Rc<RefCell<Vec<DecisionDetail>>>`, `Box<dyn Decider>`), so no `unsafe`
  hand-off: the thread sends the finished `ReviewSession` on a one-item terminal channel and
  `into_session()` joins for it.
- R02-002's open gap is CLOSED: `Gate::delivery()` counts the two `Decider` entry points and measured
  **all 158 / all 506 asks arrived via `choose_seeing`, none viewless**; a live test asserts
  `bound > 0` after real play.
- Gates: per-package fmt clean; `ti4-replayer` 19 unit + 8 engine-driven live (live suite green on 5
  repeat runs, ~3.9 s at `--test-threads=3`); `ti4-review` 33 + 3 golden unchanged; clippy
  `--no-deps -D warnings` exit 0; `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` exit 0.
- Bugs this suite caught and fixed: a `Ready` flicker between back-to-back goals (`Gate::goal_queued`
  now keeps the branch `Running`); `wait_until_parked` treating the answered-but-not-yet-resumed
  instant as terminal; a `drive` helper that dropped the last frame of a goal (test-side).
- Deviations recorded in evidence: thread + gate instead of the pre-step probe; `AdvanceGoal` maps
  `Steps`/`NextRound`/`EndOfGame` to per-step driving and leaves `Decisions`/`Actions` to R01's own
  counter (batch event instead of per-frame events); shutdown-while-parked answers from the policy and
  counts `shutdown_fallbacks`, while `stop` deliberately does not interrupt a park; `faction: None` on
  pending offers (presentation-only; the GUI fills it from the manifest); `ManualControl::
  delegate_seat_once` added for the early-click delegation; `ManualInbox` kept for R02-004's replay
  prefix and the detached-gate tests.

### Handover checkpoint after R02-003 (for the next session)

```text
Objective:          R02 interactive branching replayer, plans/R02_REPLAYER.md, package by package.
Normative sources:  plans/R02_REPLAYER.md (untracked, operator-supplied) + accepted Rust specs.
                    Historical Python reference NOT used.
Active milestone:   R02. Done: R02-001, R02-002, R02-003 (each committed, each with evidence).
Branch / HEAD:      wp/r02-003-manual-live-controller @ 5d29ffe
                    (chain: 31445af -> 185034b -> 314adcf -> 5d29ffe)
Working tree:       clean apart from the operator's own files, which must stay unstaged:
                    crates/ti4-mlp/examples/{capture_offline_pilot,offline_bc}.rs (also NOT fmt
                    clean: use per-package `cargo fmt -p`, never --all), plans/INDEX.md,
                    scripts/publish_and_train_stopped_corpus.ps1, untracked plans/R02_REPLAYER.md
                    and target-cuda-repack/.
Tests last run:     cargo test -p ti4-replayer -> 19 unit + 8 live passed; -p ti4-review -> 33 unit
                    + 3 semantic golden passed; fmt clean; clippy -p ti4-replayer --all-targets
                    --no-deps -D warnings exit 0; cargo check --workspace --all-targets exit 0.
Compatibility:      Python parity not an acceptance criterion. R01's own semantic golden still
                    passes, which is the reviewer-side regression backstop.
Review:             WAIVED by the operator for all of R02 (2026-09-18). None performed, none claimed.
Decisions open:     none blocking. Four defaults taken earlier are listed above (frames/bounds,
                    authoritative ReplayRecord, R01 import re-verifies hashes, golden first).
Blockers:           none.
Next exact action:  branch wp/r02-004-deterministic-rebuild from 5d29ffe, then read
                    plans/R02_REPLAYER.md R02-004 + this file's R02-003 section, and start with
                    src/fingerprint.rs (the versioned frame SHA-256 the plan specifies).
Read first:         plans/EXECUTION_STATE.md (this section), plans/evidence/R02-003.md,
                    crates/ti4-replayer/src/live.rs, crates/ti4-replayer/src/decider.rs.
```

## 2026-09-18 R02-004 deterministic reconstruction: implemented, all gates green

Evidence: `plans/evidence/R02-004.md`. Branch `wp/r02-004-deterministic-rebuild`.

- `src/fingerprint.rs`: `FrameFingerprint` = versioned SHA-256 over engine step, decision/action
  counts, round, phase, active, resolved_choice, action_completed, finished, error, new events,
  structured events and the **whole `GameState`** (paths/branch/UI/timestamps/manifest/frame index
  excluded; version string inside the digest). `first_difference` names the field that diverged.
- `src/rebuild.rs`: `ReplayScript` (validates actor -> prompt -> ordered ids -> typed context ->
  chosen-on-offer -> `ChoiceFingerprint`), `RebuildTarget::{Frame,End}`, `RebuildBounds` inherited
  from R01 (`MAX_COMMAND_STEPS` 2,000,000 / `MAX_FRAMES` 1,000,001), typed `RebuildError`
  (`Diverged`/`FrameMismatch`/`PolicyFailed`/`EngineFailed`/`TargetUnavailable`/`BoundsExceeded`/
  `Cancelled`/`Setup`) and `rebuild()` driving `AdvanceUnit::Step` one step at a time, digesting every
  frame, polling the cancel flag per step, and returning **no branch** on any failure.
- `Gate` gained: the replay slot (plan priority order: replay prefix, one-shot delegation, Auto policy,
  then queued manual answer), `divergence()`, `policy_failure()`, `replayed()`/`policy_calls()`
  counters, `begin_frame`/`current_ordinal`, and `enable_recording()` which writes a `ReplayRecord`
  built from the **engine's own `Choice`** through `ReplayRecord::record` (never from R01's trace,
  which mixes synthetic `fleet decision`/`plan stopped` rows and projects the context).
- Headline result: a forced 4-choice prefix followed by Auto play reproduced a 40-step run **frame
  for frame** (whole-state digests), proving the invoke-once-and-discard RNG rule is load-bearing.
  `a_terminal_target_rebuilds_exactly` replays a whole game to its terminal frame and matches; that
  one test costs 193 s, which is why the rebuild suite is ~200 s.
- Refusal is belt-and-braces: a prefix mismatch records the typed divergence **and** the decorator
  returns `IllegalChoice::NotOffered{chosen:"r02-rebuild-refused"}` so the step poisons; a branch that
  cannot account for a decision can never look playable.
- Gates: per-package fmt clean; `ti4-replayer` 23 unit + 8 live + 12 rebuild = 43 passed; `ti4-review`
  33 unit + 3 golden unchanged; clippy `--no-deps -D warnings` exit 0; `cargo check --workspace
  --all-targets` exit 0. No engine or `ti4-review` file touched.
- Deviations recorded in evidence: the plan's "one narrow engine invariant test" is **dropped** under
  the operator's engine freeze (the multi-ask invariant is instead measured and asserted from outside
  via `a_prefix_with_several_asks_in_one_frame_rebuilds_exactly` + R02-003's ask counts);
  `Rebuilt` returns the non-`Send` `LiveReview` on the calling thread, so R02-007 must call
  `rebuild()` inside the branch thread (or use `Gate::replaying` with `LiveBranch`); cancellation is
  polled per step (the deterministic pre-set flag is what is tested); recording is opt-in.

## 2026-09-18 R02-005 branch tree and persistence: implemented, all gates green

Evidence: `plans/evidence/R02-005.md`. Branch `wp/r02-005-branch-tree-persistence` (from `60a364a`).

- `src/project.rs`: `ReplayerProject` (schema `r02-replayer-project` v1, `deny_unknown_fields`,
  SHA-256 payload checksum), `ReplayInputs` (R01's seven knobs), `SourceTimeline` (session/checkpoint/
  pool SHA-256 at import + engine commit + content digest + frames + seating), `Branch` (id, parent,
  `Origin::Imported|Fork{frame}`, title, seats, **only its own answers**, frames, `verified`,
  optional UI value), `ProjectError`, `Verification`, `validate()`, `fork()`, `extend()`, `prefix()`,
  `replay_script()`, `mark_verified()`, `set_ui()`, `total_frames()`, `verify_inputs()`.
- `src/persistence.rs`: `save_project`/`load_project` (JSON; zstd iff the path ends in `.zst`, exactly
  as R01 chooses), `MAX_PROJECT_BYTES = ti4_review::MAX_SESSION_BYTES`, R01's temp/backup/rename/restore
  write, decompressed-stream bound, `sha256_file`.
- `ti4-review` gained one additive line: `pub const ENGINE_COMMIT` (the recorded commit promoted from
  an internal `env!`) so anything replaying a session can check it. R01's JSON/HTML/bounds untouched.
- Prefix rule (makes branching non-destructive without duplication): walk branch-0 -> branch and take
  each ancestor's answers strictly before the frame where the next branch diverged; sort by
  `(frame, ask)`. `prefix()` is what `rebuild()` consumes.
- Verification: `verify_inputs` re-hashes checkpoint/pool and enforces the content digest;
  `Branch::playable(&Verification)` needs the branch's own `verified` flag AND that check, so a swapped
  checkpoint takes the whole tree out of play. **Recorded judgement call:** an *engine commit*
mismatch is reported (`engine_matches`) rather than refused, because R01 stamps the repository commit
of the build, so enforcing it would reject every session made before the latest commit while proving
nothing about replay; the commit is surfaced for R02-007's disabled-Play tooltip.
- Gates: per-package fmt clean; `ti4-replayer` 23 unit + 8 live + 12 rebuild + **20 project** = 63
  passed; `ti4-review` 33 + 3 unchanged; clippy `--no-deps -D warnings` exit 0 on **both** touched
  crates; `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` exit 0.
- End-to-end coverage added: `a_saved_project_rebuilds_what_it_recorded` (play 12 steps -> write the
  session with R01's writer -> import -> save `.zst` -> load -> rebuild -> compare every frame
  fingerprint) and `only_a_reproduced_fork_becomes_live` (fork is not playable, rebuild, mark
  verified, is playable).
- **Pre-existing workspace failures found and recorded, NOT fixed** (`cargo test --workspace
  --no-fail-fast`: 38 targets ok, 4 failing): `ti4-bridge` `hexsummary_golden`/`import_golden`/
  `wire_golden` and `ti4-mlp` `smoke_refusals` need corpora/artifacts that were never committed
  (`crates/ti4-bridge/tests/golden/*`, `out/vocabulary/current.json`); `os error 3` panics from tests
  added in `53a4efa`, and `cargo tree -i ti4-review` shows only `ti4-replayer` depends on it. Needs a
  separate housekeeping package (commit the corpora or gate the tests); flagged for the R02-008
  handoff. Do not invent fixtures to silence them.

## 2026-09-18 R02-006 split recorded before implementation (a/b/c)

`plans/PI_WORK_PACKAGE_STANDARD.md` allows a package row that is too large to be split into suffixed
children, provided the split is recorded before implementation and each child preserves the parent's
acceptance criterion. `crates/ti4-review/src/gui.rs` is 2,739 lines / 121 KB, and a single `impl
ReviewApp` block spans lines 630-2670, so R02-006 ("extract the shared presentation for both apps,
R01 UX unchanged") cannot be one atomic package. Parent criterion, preserved by all three children:
**both apps render from one presentation layer and R01's on-screen output does not change.**

Extraction map from the measured file (line numbers as of `cda2e6d`):

| Area | Current location | Size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| palette + pure helpers (`SEAT_COLORS`, `NEUTRAL_COLOR`, `PANEL_TEXT/FILL`, `seat_index`, `player_color`, `short_trait`, `short_specialty`, `item_section`, `seat_label`, `section`, `section_with_id`, `stat_badge`, `content_label`, `unit_base`, `planets_for_tile`, `polygon`, `anomaly_style`, `wormhole_style`, `draw_wormhole`, `draw_fracture_portal`, `draw_unit_symbol`) | gui.rs 38-538 (free functions) | ~500 lines |
| diplomacy panel | gui.rs 139-238 | ~100 |
| top bar / controls (advance, seek, run count) | gui.rs 1037-1249 | ~210 |
| player panel (players, table, objectives, status) | gui.rs 1249-1855 | ~600 |
| decision panel | gui.rs 1855-2187 | ~330 |
| board (hexes, units, anomalies, wormholes) | gui.rs 2187-2671 | ~480 |
| frame layout / timeline / run loop | gui.rs 630-1037, 2671-2700 | ~440 |

- **R02-006a** — create `crates/ti4-review/src/view.rs` and move the pure palette + helper layer above
  into it (`pub`, frame/stateless, no `LiveReview`, no app state); gui.rs calls the same functions via
  `view::`. Tests pin what the layer owes: seat colors, trait/specialty abbreviations, wormhole and
  anomaly styles, hex `polygon` geometry, `content_label`/`unit_base` strings, and the section/row
  item ordering. Zero behaviour change; every existing R01 test must stay green.
- **R02-006b** — immutable view *models* built from `&ReviewSession` + `&ReviewFrame` (board tiles with
  labels, player rows, objective rows, action summary rows) and the board + player panels rendered
  from them. Highest UX risk: needs before/after control-availability and data equality, plus
  view-model snapshots.
- **R02-006c** — decision, event and timeline views; the shared layer is then what R02-007 draws
  beside its seat chips, pending-choice panel and branch selector.

Review is waived for this run by the operator, as for every R02 package. `ti4-review`'s 33 unit + 3
semantic golden tests are the regression backstop for all three children, and each child must keep
`cargo clippy -p ti4-review --all-targets --no-deps -- -D warnings` at exit 0.

## 2026-09-18 R02-006a shared presentation layer: implemented, all gates green

Evidence: `plans/evidence/R02-006a.md`. Branch `wp/r02-006a-shared-view` (from `edef24f`).

- New `crates/ti4-review/src/view.rs` (`pub mod view;` in lib.rs): the seat palette
  (`SEAT_COLORS`, `NEUTRAL_COLOR`, `PANEL_TEXT`, `PANEL_FILL`), identity (`seat_index`,
  `player_color`, `short_trait`, `short_specialty`), chrome (`section`, `section_with_id`,
  `item_section`, `seat_label`, `stat_badge`), naming (`content_label`, `unit_base`,
  `planets_for_tile`) and geometry/glyphs (`polygon`, `anomaly_style`, `wormhole_style`,
  `draw_wormhole`, `draw_fracture_portal`, `draw_unit_symbol`). Pure: no app state, no `LiveReview`,
  no clock, no filesystem. `gui.rs` shrank 370 non-blank lines and gained one `use crate::view::{..}`
  block, so the 2,371 remaining lines are untouched apart from the import.
- **Move proved mechanically, not asserted**: (a) the moved text vs `view.rs` body (with `pub ` stripped)
  is one rustfmt re-wrap hunk of `item_section`'s signature and nothing else; (b) `gui.rs` vs
  `HEAD` minus the same spans is one line — the `use ti4_model::units::Unit;` that moved with its only
  user. R01's rendering code is byte-identical, reached through a module path.
- 11 snapshot tests in `crates/ti4-review/tests/presentation.rs`: exact seat RGBs + distinctness +
  neutral, seat6 palette wrap, non-seat ids stay neutral, C/H/I + G/Y/B/R/T abbreviations with
  first-rule-wins, five anomaly colours/labels **and their precedence**, four wormhole glyphs + grey
  `?`, polygon regularity/stepping/rotation (with `atan2` wrap normalization) and the fighter-up /
  dreadnought-due-east glyph facts, `unit_base` base-type resolution, `content_label`'s `Name [id]`
  over 100+ real corpus records, and `planets_for_tile` merge order / no-duplicate / no-cross-system
  leak / determinism.
- Gates: `cargo test -p ti4-review` = 33 unit + 11 presentation + 3 semantic golden = 47 passed;
  clippy `--no-deps -D warnings` exit 0; `ti4-replayer` 23 + 8 + 20 + 11 passed (terminal-target
  rebuild test skipped here, re-run at the R02-005 gate, no library it uses changed);
  `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` exit 0.
- Two facts recorded for later packages: the R02-002 golden
  (`crates/ti4-review/tests/golden/pre-r02-mlp-seed7777-rotation2.json`) is a semantic **projection**,
  not a `ReviewSession`, so it cannot be fed to `load_session`; and a real session with a real
  `GameState` is cheapest obtained from `LiveReview::start` on the committed example inputs at frame
  zero (~0.4 s), with game state injected by the test — neither type derives `Default`.

## 2026-09-18 R02-006b board view model: implemented, all gates green

Evidence: `plans/evidence/R02-006b.md`. Branch `wp/r02-006b-view-models` (from `e6e3c8a`).

- `view::board_view(content, session, frame, selected)` -> one `TileView` per **visible** tile:
  `fill`/`color` (via `tile_fill`, which also returns *which* rule won), `label` (purged suffix),
  `anomaly_label`, `space_owner` (None when contested or when only ground troops are present),
  `planet_owners` (sorted/deduped, purged planets excluded), `selected`, `portal_linked`, `ingress`,
  `egress`, `wormholes` (printed + tokens + ion storm in draw order, suppression resolved),
  `units`/`ground` (`unit_stacks` keyed by owner+base+damaged+galvanized), `command_tokens`,
  `token_labels`, `planets` (`PlanetView`: owner, purged, color, `trait_label`, `badge`, coexisting,
  attachments). Plus shared geometry `hex_corners` and `planet_offset`. No `Pos2` in the model:
  meaning is a function of the frame, position is a function of the window.
- `gui.rs::board()` shrank **481 -> 260 lines** and is now geometry and strokes only.
- **How R01 output was shown unchanged** (byte-identity is impossible for a rewritten renderer, so the
  evidence used is stated rather than overclaimed): (a) renderer operation inventory identical -
  `painter.add` 4=4, `painter.text` 8=8, `circle_filled` 3=3, `circle_stroke` 3=3, `line_segment` 1=1,
  portals 2=2, unit symbols 2=2; the only change is `draw_wormhole` 3 -> 1 (three sources became one
  loop over the model's ordered list, with a test that a token cannot displace a printed hole);
  (b) derivations lifted as expressions rather than paraphrased; (c) the decisions are now tested
  where they previously had zero tests; (d) R01's 33 unit + 3 semantic golden tests pass unchanged.
- **Recorded behavioural difference:** the old loop re-read `self.selected_tile` per tile, so during
  the single frame a click landed, later tiles drew with the previous selection. The model snapshots
  the selection for the frame. The old behaviour was a loop artifact, not a design.
- 11 new tests (`crates/ti4-review/tests/board_view.rs`) pin fill precedence with exact colours,
  hex/ring geometry, planet offsets (including no underflow at count 0), stack grouping and order,
  Fracture and Nexus visibility, portal linking in both directions, single-vs-contested space control,
  infantry not controlling space, purged planets, the planet colour rule across **every** planet of a
  real board, garrison/coexistence/attachments, trait-line shape, suppression semantics, and model
  determinism. Frames are real setup frames from the committed example inputs; the state that matters
  (ownership, purged planets, ingress tokens, egress via `session.board`, elected `travel_ban`) is
  injected so the tests fail if a rule changes.
- Re-split recorded: **R02-006c** now covers `player_panel` (~606 lines), `decision_panel` (~330) and
  the timeline, since the board alone filled a package.

## 2026-09-18 R02-006c decision/step/system-card view models: implemented, all gates green

Evidence: `plans/evidence/R02-006c.md`. Branch `wp/r02-006c-panel-view-models` (from `60f5bb4`).

- `view.rs` gained `StepView`/`step_view`, `DecisionPath`/`path_kind`, `DecisionRow`/`decision_rows`,
  `RankInfo`, `OptionRow`, `FeatureRow`, `ActionSummaryView`/`action_summary`, `EventRow`/`event_rows`,
  `SelectedSystemView`/`selected_system`, and `precision`/`precision3`/`json_pretty`.
  `gui.rs::decision_panel` went **331 -> 184 lines**; what is left is widgets.
- Evidence that R01 still says the same things (byte-identity is impossible for a rewrite):
  (a) **string-literal inventory** - 66 fixed strings in the old panel, 33 remain in the new one, and
  every one of the 33 that moved is present in `view.rs`; the only four exceptions are format-string
  spellings with identical output (`Chosen rank {rank}/{}...` -> pre-formatted `{:.5}` values,
  `Round {} · {:?} · active {}` -> `step.phase` pre-applied, `Selected system {tile}` -> `{system}`,
  `{:.3}` -> inside `precision3`); (b) **widget inventory** identical except three counts that fall
  because loops replaced repetitions (`ui.colored_label` 3->2, `ui.strong` 11->10, `ui.label` 26->18);
  (c) derivations (rank sort, position, best fallback, rank-based `below_greedy`, summary format, tick
  rule, column formats, span suffix, planet-line format) lifted as expressions; (d) R01's 33 unit +
  3 semantic golden tests unchanged. No behavioural difference found or accepted.
- 10 tests in `crates/ti4-review/tests/decision_view.rs` over **real** decisions produced by
  `LiveReview::advance(Step, 12)` on the committed inputs, each row compared field by field against the
  recorded `DecisionDetail`, plus bent clones for: no choice, no probabilities, no context, and a
  choice outside the offered set (not ranked, ticks nothing). Also: em-dash rules, phase spelling,
  agenda line order/wording, unknown decision paths preserved verbatim, action-in-progress vs latest
  completed (with the ` · IN PROGRESS` suffix), event titles/cancelled/`{}` payloads, the system card
  for a real tile vs an unknown system, dynamic-state JSON, and frame purity.
- **Scope decision recorded:** `player_panel` (~606 lines) is deferred to **R02-006d** rather than
  squeezed into this package. R02-007 can compose a player sheet from the primitives `view` already
  exposes (`section`, `item_section`, `player_color`, `content_label`, `stat_badge`), and a rushed
  600-line extraction would have been the worst kind of "while I was in there".
- Gates: `cargo test -p ti4-review` = 33 + 11 board_view + **10 decision_view** + 11 presentation +
  3 golden = **68 passed**; clippy `--no-deps -D warnings` exit 0; replayer 23+8+20+11 passed;
  `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` exit 0.

Next ready package: **R02-007 native replayer GUI** (`plans/R02_REPLAYER.md`), which now has every
piece it needs: `view::board_view` (006b), `view::decision_rows`/`step_view`/`event_rows`/
`selected_system` (006c), palette/chrome/geometry (006a), and `LiveBranch` + `rebuild` + `ReplayerProject`
+ `load_project` (001-005). First exact action when it starts: `git checkout -b wp/r02-007-replayer-gui`,
read `plans/R02_REPLAYER.md` §R02-007, `plans/evidence/R02-006c.md`, `crates/ti4-replayer/src/lib.rs`,
and `crates/ti4-review/src/view.rs`; it must verify `engine_commit`/`content_sha256` up front and
disable "Play from this frame" with a tooltip rather than starting a wrong run. Optional smaller
package if preferred first: **R02-006d** (player panel). Working tree is clean apart from the
operator's own uncommitted files (`crates/ti4-mlp/examples/capture_offline_pilot.rs`,
`crates/ti4-mlp/examples/offline_bc.rs`, `plans/INDEX.md`,
`scripts/publish_and_train_stopped_corpus.ps1`, untracked `plans/R02_REPLAYER.md`,
`target-cuda-repack/`); never stage them.

## 2026-09-18 R02-007a replayer app reducer: implemented, all gates green

Evidence: `plans/evidence/R02-007a.md`. Branch `wp/r02-007a-app-reducer` (from `0568c01`, tip of
`wp/r02-006c-panel-view-models`).

R02-007 was split before implementation into **007a** (the application state and its rules, no egui)
and **007b** (the eframe shell, both release builds, Windows smoke with screenshots). Reason: the
plan's own test list is stated as *GUI reducer states*, and every rule in it — disable buttons after
submit, tooltip every disabled Play state, never overwrite R01 settings, navigation never branches,
branch retains future, safe close while rebuilding, separate settings — is decidable in plain data.
The half that needs a desktop is only the painting. The parent acceptance criterion is preserved
across the children and quoted in the evidence file.

- `crates/ti4-replayer/src/app.rs` (new): `ReplayApp<H>`, `BranchHandle` (+ `impl BranchHandle for
  Gate` as the single bridge to the engine), `PlayBlock` with a `tooltip()` per refusal, `PlayPlan`,
  `RebuildOutcome`/`RebuildStatus`, `BranchNode`/`tree()`, `ReplaySettings` + `SETTINGS_PATH =
  "out/replays/replayer-settings.json"` (atomic write; unreadable or unknown-shaped ⇒ defaults).
- `crates/ti4-replayer/tests/app.rs` (new): 18 tests over a *gate-shaped* fake branch — it releases a
  parked choice only when its own seat returns to `Auto`, refuses a fingerprint that is not on screen,
  and treats `pause()` as a request. No engine run, no window, 0.01 s.
- Only library change outside the new file: `pub mod app;` in `crates/ti4-replayer/src/lib.rs`.
  `control`/`decider`/`fingerprint`/`live`/`project`/`persistence`/`rebuild` and both `ti4-review` and
  `ti4-engine` are untouched.

Three rules the tests corrected in the first draft (recorded so they are not "re-fixed" later):

1. `play_check` must not use `LiveState::accepts_run()` — that includes `Ready`, which would refuse
   Play for a freshly attached branch, i.e. the headline feature. Only `Running | WaitingForHuman`
   block.
2. Only `RebuildStatus::Running` blocks Play. Blocking on `!= Idle` let one refused fork disable the
   button for the rest of the session.
3. `at_tip()` requires at least one frame; a branch with zero frames is not "at the live tip".

Design decisions worth carrying into 007b:

- `plan_play` allocates the fork and returns a `PlayPlan` instead of rebuilding, because `rebuild()`
  returns a non-`Send` `LiveReview` (R02-004) and must run on the thread that will own the branch.
  The shell runs `ti4_replayer::rebuild()` on a worker and reports with `finish_rebuild` /
  `fail_rebuild` / `cancel_rebuild`. This is also what makes "safe close while rebuilding" testable.
- `discard_fork` removes only a child with no children and never rewinds `next_branch`; ids are not
  reused. That is not the pruning the master plan defers — it removes a branch the app made seconds
  earlier, because R02-005 forbids an unreproduced branch looking playable.
- Frames are held per branch in the app (`FrameTick`s actually seen); `ReplayerProject` keeps a frame
  *count* for the budget. `tree()` takes the max so a branch never looks shorter than it is.

Gates: `cargo test -p ti4-replayer` = 23 lib + **18 app** + 8 live + 20 project + 11 rebuild
(terminal-target rebuild filtered — green at R02-005, no `rebuild.rs`/`live.rs` line changed);
`cargo clippy -p ti4-replayer --all-targets --no-deps -- -D warnings` exit 0; `cargo fmt -p
ti4-replayer --check` exit 0; `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` exit 0 (warnings only in
`ti4-mlp/examples/opening_plan.rs` and `ti4-training/examples/seat_advantage.rs`, untouched by R02).

Next ready package: **R02-007b replayer shell** — `crates/ti4-replayer/src/main.rs` + `src/gui.rs`
drawing `ti4_review::view` models (006a/b/c) and calling only the `ReplayApp` methods, plus both
release builds and an operator-run Windows smoke pass with screenshots for `plans/evidence/R02-007.md`.
First exact actions: `git checkout -b wp/r02-007b-replayer-shell`; read `plans/R02_REPLAYER.md`
§R02-007, `plans/evidence/R02-007a.md`, `crates/ti4-replayer/src/app.rs`, and
`crates/ti4-review/src/gui.rs` (for the run loop and top bar to mirror). Optional and still not
required: **R02-006d** (player panel). Working tree is clean apart from the operator's own
uncommitted files (`crates/ti4-mlp/examples/capture_offline_pilot.rs`,

## 2026-09-18 R02-006e shared board painter: implemented, all gates green

Evidence: `plans/evidence/R02-006e.md`. Branch `wp/r02-006e-board-painter` (from `15b7828`, tip of
`wp/r02-007a-app-reducer`).

A fifth child was added to R02-006 while starting R02-007b: 006a-c moved the board's *meaning* into
`view`, but the *strokes* were still private inside `ReviewApp::board` and coupled to
`self.selected_tile`, so the replayer's only alternative was to copy 234 lines of geometry. That is
the thing R02-006 exists to prevent, so it is fixed here rather than in the shell.

- `crates/ti4-review/src/view.rs` gains `BoardLayout` (+ `new`), `tile_point`, `fracture_shown` and
  `draw_board(painter, response, layout, tiles) -> Option<String>`.
- `ReviewApp::board()` is 28 lines (was 260); `gui.rs` 1,986 -> 1,753 and no longer imports
  `Align2/FontId/Pos2/Shape/Stroke/Vec2/hex_corners/planet_offset/draw_wormhole/draw_fracture_portal/
  draw_unit_symbol`.
- New `crates/ti4-review/tests/board_layout.rs` (6 tests) pins the geometry that used to be four
  local variables: scale clamps (0.45/1.2), the 72 px Fracture band, 126/108/63 axial spacing
  including the 0.8 % projection squish, edge anchoring of the two special areas, 37 tiles, and
  `fracture_shown` == `frame.state.fracture_in_play` over 13 real frames plus a forced positive.

Proof the move did not change R01: two machine comparisons against `HEAD` after renames only —
`tile_point == moved position formula: True (390 chars)` and `draw_board body == moved painter code:
True (4,915 chars)`, normalising whitespace and the one trailing comma rustfmt added. Eight
adaptations are listed in full in the evidence; seven are renames, one returns the clicked system
instead of writing a field, and one derives the Fracture label from the tiles instead of the frame
(equivalence tested). Painter operations: 19 before, 19 after.

Three implementer assumptions were falsified by the new tests before shipping: the r-step skew is 63 px
(not 54), the example map draws 37 tiles (not 52), and diagonal neighbour spacing is 125.032 rather
than equal to the 126 row spacing, so "six equidistant neighbours" is not a property of this
projection.

Decision recorded: `decision_panel`, `player_panel`, timeline and top bar are **not** extracted. The
replayer wants a choice panel, a branch selector and rebuild progress beside its timeline, so
generalising R01's widgets would reshape them for an app that does not use them that way; R02-007b
composes its own panels from the `view::` models 006b/c already provide.

Gates: `cargo test -p ti4-review` = 33 + **6 board_layout** + 11 board_view + 10 decision_view + 11
presentation + 3 golden = **74 passed**; clippy `--all-targets --no-deps -D warnings` exit 0; fmt exit
0; `cargo test -p ti4-replayer --lib --test app --test live --test project` = 23+18+8+20 passed;
`cargo check --workspace --all-targets` exit 0.

Next ready package: **R02-007b replayer shell** — `crates/ti4-replayer/src/{main.rs,gui.rs}`: eframe
window, top bar (open/import a project, run controls), six seat chips, the persistent manual-choice
panel, the branch selector beside the timeline, Play + rebuild progress/cancel wired to
`ReplayApp::plan_play` + a worker thread + `finish_rebuild`/`fail_rebuild`/`cancel_rebuild`, the
live-tip versus viewed-frame marker, `ReplaySettings` persistence, both release builds, and the
operator-run Windows smoke pass with screenshots into `plans/evidence/R02-007.md`. First exact
actions: `git checkout -b wp/r02-007b-replayer-shell`; read `plans/R02_REPLAYER.md` §R02-007,
`plans/evidence/R02-007a.md`, `plans/evidence/R02-006e.md`, `crates/ti4-replayer/src/app.rs`, and
`crates/ti4-review/src/gui.rs` (for the run loop, top bar and `with_session` pattern). Optional and
still not required: **R02-006d** (player panel). Working tree is clean apart from the operator's own
uncommitted files (`crates/ti4-mlp/examples/capture_offline_pilot.rs`,
`crates/ti4-mlp/examples/offline_bc.rs`, `plans/INDEX.md`,

`target-cuda-repack/`); never stage them.

## 2026-09-19 R02-007b replayer shell: implemented, all gates green

Branch `wp/r02-007b-replayer-shell` from `10dd96e`. `crates/ti4-replayer` is now an application:
`src/gui.rs` (the window), `src/main.rs` (`ti4-replayer <session-or-project>` opens it with a file
already loaded; `inspect`/`import` at the terminal), `src/store.rs` (what the window can draw per
branch, plus `ticks`/`own_answers`/`fold_answers`). The shell calls `ReplayApp` methods and decides
nothing itself; it draws through `view::board_view`/`BoardLayout`/`draw_board`, so its board is R01's
board stroke for stroke.

Architecture, unchanged in writing and now enforced by the shell: `LiveReview` is not `Send`, so no
thread but the branch's ever holds the game. Frames cross into the UI through a bounded feed on the
`Gate` (header once, deduped by index, oldest dropped and counted), so a window that falls behind loses
pictures and never legality. `LiveBranch::replay` rebuilds a fork's prefix and then stays answerable on
the same thread.

Five real bugs were found by `tests/shell.rs` before any pixel was trusted, all fixed and all now
regression-tested: opening a session left the reducer blind (`NoFrame` forever); imported projects
carried no answers, so Play would have rebuilt a prefix out of nothing and called it a replay; the
import's first version wrote a project its own loader refused (stale checksum); a fork inherited
`Gate::replaying`'s non-blocking gate and answered the operator's own seat with the policy (fixed by
`Gate::replaying_interactive`); and a hand answer was recorded on the engine thread after the panel
closed, so Save could race it away (fixed by recording inside `Gate::submit`, plus `dropped_records`
so a lost decision can never be silent). Checkpoints that are MLP bundles are now hashable
(`sha256_path`), which is what makes the operator's real sessions importable at all.

Gates: `cargo test -p ti4-replayer` = 34 + 18 + 6 + **4 shell** + 8 + 22 + 12 = **102 passed**;
`cargo test -p ti4-review` = **74 passed**; clippy `--all-targets --no-deps -D warnings` exit 0 on both
crates; fmt exit 0; `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` exit 0; `cargo build --release -p ti4-review
-p ti4-replayer` builds both executables. Window smoke from a shell: title `TI4 game replayer`,
1736x1019, no panic in 30 s, settings written to `out/replays/replayer-settings.json` on close, screen
capture left at `target/r02-007b-window.png`. The assistant cannot see images, so the operator's eyes
are still required: **R02-007 acceptance is not closed until the operator has driven the window.**

Next ready package: **R02-008 integration and handoff**. First exact actions: read
`plans/R02_REPLAYER.md` §R02-008 and `plans/evidence/R02-007b.md`; then the all-Auto equality gate
between R01 and R02 (same checkpoint/pool/seed/rotation/temperature, R02 with every seat Auto, compared
frame-by-frame through `FrameFingerprint`), then manual control at action, reaction, combat, transaction,
production-payment and agenda decisions at early/round-end/late points, then budget caps and operator
documentation. Optional and still not required: **R02-006d** (player panel).

A check against the operator's own 4,481-frame recording found that a recording made by a *different*
engine build cannot be forked at all: frame 0 does not reproduce (`FrameMismatch { index: 0 }`), after the
prefix machinery had correctly counted 3,493 decisions to force. Import, answers, hashing and the file
round trip are all fine; the build that recorded it is not this one, which `inspect` had already said in
other words. R02-008's first task is therefore a forkability pre-check (rebuild frame 0 before offering
Play, refuse with a tooltip) plus comparing the checkpoint and map-pool hashes against what the recording
itself claims rather than only against what this import saw. Details and the exact output are in
`plans/evidence/R02-007b.md`.

Carry forward: pre-existing unrelated failures (`ti4-bridge` `hexsummary_golden`/`import_golden`/
`wire_golden` missing committed golden corpora; `ti4-mlp --test smoke_refusals` needing a generated
vocabulary) - do not invent fixtures. Working tree apart from this package's files holds the operator's
own uncommitted work (`crates/ti4-mlp/examples/capture_offline_pilot.rs`,
`crates/ti4-mlp/examples/offline_bc.rs`, `plans/INDEX.md`,
`scripts/publish_and_train_stopped_corpus.ps1`, `target-cuda-repack/`); never stage them.

## 2026-09-19 R02-007c operator feedback: start a table in the window

The operator tried R02-007b and could not use it: no way to set up a game, no way to pick the profiles,
two buttons named after file formats, and my suggested command failed on a file that only exists if you
run the previous command first. They were right on all three. R01's window has had "Load starting table"
with checkpoint / map pool / seed / faction rotation / profile table / temperature / structured diplomacy
its whole life, so a sibling window without those words is not a replayer, it is a viewer with extra
steps.

Added: a setup form in the replayer with the reviewer's own labels (shown as the welcome screen when
nothing is open, as a floating panel otherwise); `ReplayerProject::live_table` plus `Origin::Live`, so a
table has a project - inputs, input hashes, content, seating, verified, playable, empty prefix - before
any recording exists; buttons renamed to "Open recorded game…" and "Open replayer file…" with the
distinction in the tooltips and a paragraph on screen; and a missing path now says what it expected
instead of reciting a usage line. Taking a seat is one checkbox ("Take seat 0 now") or one chip toggle
later. Saving a table still writes only the replayer file - recording a hand-played table means joining
the branch thread, which is its own button and its own words, deferred to R02-008 with the frame-0
pre-check.

Evidence: `plans/evidence/R02-007c.md`. Note for the next session: while the operator has a replayer
window open, cargo cannot replace `target/debug/ti4-replayer.exe`, so any `cargo test` that builds the
package's bin fails with "Access is denied"; use `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target/verify` rather than killing
their window.

Next ready package: **R02-008 integration and handoff**, first task now elevated: make "play a game"
the documented default path (start a table in the window, take a seat, answer, save), then the frame-0
forkability pre-check, the recording's-own-claims check against `SessionManifest::checkpoint_sha256` and
`map_pool_sha256`, "finish and record" for hand-played tables, the R01-vs-R02 all-Auto equality gate,
manual control across decision kinds, budget caps and operator documentation.

## 2026-09-19 R02-007d: the replayer's sheets, and the crash that pass shipped

A pass on the operator's six-item list moved R01's player and decision sheets into
`ti4-review/src/panels.rs` so both windows render the same code, fixed the frozen board
(`at_tip()` asked after appending), made the fork prefix cut inclusive, folded live answers
before planning, swapped the gate at fork start, and named systems by tile and planets.

It also shipped a crash. The shared sheets read their history from `session.frames`; the replayer's
store hands out a session shell with `frames` emptied on purpose, so opening anything painted a range
out of an empty slice: `range end index 0 out of range for slice of length 0`. Fixed with
`panels::Sheets { header, frames }` - R01 passes `Sheets::whole(session)`, the replayer passes the
branch's list - plus a total `view::action_summary_in` and `Sheets::previous` by index. Four new tests
paint the shell shape (two in `panel_paint.rs`, one in `table.rs` through the real store, one asserting
R01's answers are unchanged). `ti4-review` 82 and `ti4-replayer` 112 pass; clippy and fmt exit 0; the
release binary holds a 4,481-frame recording open with an empty stderr.

The pattern to remember, twice now in two packages: the fixtures had R01's shape while the code ran with
the replayer's. A logic suite, or even a paint suite, does not notice. Before any further panel work,
paint through the store the way the window does.

Next: the operator drives the window (seat chips, Play/fork, objectives and diplomacy in the left sheet,
system naming). R02-008 keeps the frame-0 forkability pre-check, verifying a recording against the
checkpoint hash in its own manifest, "finish and record" for a hand-played table, the R01-vs-R02 all-Auto
equality gate, budget caps and operator documentation.

## 2026-09-19 R02-007e: remember the table; three playing bugs recorded, not guessed at

The operator asked for the reviewer to keep the last game's profile, map and settings as defaults, and
reported three playing defects (L1Z1X agents, transactions with Hacan, diplomacy generally).

Fixed the settings defect in both windows. R01 restored its checkpoint, pool, profile table, temperature
and diplomacy from `out/reviews/reviewer-settings.json` and then hard-coded `seed: "42"`, `rotation: 0` -
which is not cosmetic, because seed and rotation choose who sits where, so re-opening a run described a
different game. Both fields are now remembered (seed as text; `normalize_seed` covers a blank memory).
The replayer's setup form remembered nothing and its window settings were rebuilt from `Default` on every
write; there is now `SetupDefaults` (checkpoint, pool, seed, rotation, profile table, temperature,
diplomacy), the form opens from it, the window size is written back, and the table is remembered when it
*starts*, not only on a clean exit. Proved end to end by launching the release binary, closing it with
`CloseMainWindow()` and reading the `setup` group out of `out/replays/replayer-settings.json`; a killed
process never reaches `on_exit`, which is how the first two attempts taught me nothing.

The three playing defects are recorded in `plans/evidence/R02-007e.md` as a ledger with what was checked
and what is unknown, and nothing was changed for them. The first thing to rule out is a table started with
structured diplomacy off - the replayer's default, my choice, and a table without it cannot transact with
anybody - so the form now says that out loud under the checkbox and remembers the value. Engine diplomacy
(`crates/ti4-engine/src/diplomacy/`) is not in R02's editable surface: if these are engine faults they
need their own item with a failing engine test; if the engine offered something the window did not
surface, that is R02-008. To reproduce I need the file the table is in, whether the seat was on Manual,
what was clicked, and what the window said.

Verification: `ti4-review` 83 passed; `ti4-replayer` 100 passed (lib/app/feed/live/project/shell/table, in
an isolated target dir because the operator's window held `target/debug/ti4-replayer.exe`; the 12 rebuild
tests were last green at `db7a220` and were not re-run for a settings-only change); clippy and fmt exit 0.

Next: the operator's four facts on the playing defects, then R02-008 (frame-0 forkability pre-check,
verifying a recording against the checkpoint hash in its own manifest, "finish and record" for a
hand-played table, R01-vs-R02 all-Auto equality, budget caps, operator documentation).

## 2026-09-19 engine authority for the named bugs; defect A located

The operator granted permission to edit whatever is necessary for the concrete bugs they named. Reading
the content text and the engine located the first one:

**A - `l1z1xagent` (and any agent whose printed window is not the action phase) is unreachable.** Its
window is "After a player activates a system:"; `leaders::component_actions` (leaders.rs:495) filters on
`is_action_window` before offering anything, and `perform_leader_action` (game.rs:1326) is the only route
from a player's choice into `use_leader`. The implementation arm (leaders.rs:1324) is there and plausible,
but nothing raises its window, and its three `return false` exits carry no reason - which is why the
symptom is "it doesn't work" rather than an explanation. Fix: raise the activation window after a system
activates, ask the seat the card names through the normal ask/settle path, and make refusals say why.
Test first, and the test must fail before the code changes.

**B - Hacan transactions: located, not pinned.** `transactions.rs` exists and looks sane (partners,
neighbours, `can_pay`, a Guild Ships test that reaches the whole table); the open question is whether a
manual seat is offered the transaction action at all. That is answerable from the operator's saved game
file - it carries faction, phase, the component options produced and the refusals - and until it is
answered, calling anything a fix would be a guess.

Details, quoted rules text and file:line for every claim: `plans/evidence/R02-007e.md`.

Next exact action: fresh context; write a failing engine test for A (L1Z1X seat, readied agent, activate a
system containing that seat's infantry, expect the ask and then the swap); then implement; then read the
operator's game file for B.

## 2026-09-19 accepted decision: transactions are subsumed under diplomacy

The operator decided that transactions belong under diplomacy rather than beside it. The reason is not
tidiness: the engine runs **two negotiation machines** - `transactions.rs` with
`open_transaction`/`offer`/`transaction` kinds and `TradeWindow`, and `diplomacy/window.rs` with
`diplomacy_offer`/`diplomacy_response`/`diplomacy_counter` and `DiplomacyWindow`. Two machines negotiating
the same thing is why "transactions with Hacan not possible, generally diplomacy buggy" reads as vague: a
seat must be asked by the right machine, the viewer renders two vocabularies, the policy is taught two
shapes, and the diplomacy journal, promises, relations and per-pair initiation budget cannot see
transactions at all.

Plan: keep `Terms` (goods, commodities, relic fragments, a note, an action card, an unscored secret, with
`describe()` and the loan asymmetry) as the payload a diplomatic deal carries; make the LRR 60 rules
(`can_pay`, `why_illegal`, `partners`, the once-per-turn limits) the legality layer of a diplomatic deal;
record deals in the diplomacy journal; retire `TradeWindow` once its tests pass against the merged path.

`plans/ENGINE_DIPLOMACY_UNIFICATION.md` is the accepted decision, and it is *not implemented*. It names
what must survive: exact rules legality including 94.3/Arbiters/Black Market and note-as-loan,
determinism, the replayable answer log (a decision-kind change needs a typed refusal for old logs, never a
silent reinterpretation), generated-not-rejected legality with reasons attached, and typed views because a
transaction can name an unscored secret objective. Packages: DIPLO-001 deals carry `Terms`; DIPLO-002 the
transaction rules move; DIPLO-003 one window and one vocabulary; DIPLO-004 what the operator sees.

Next ready work, in the order I intend it unless told otherwise: (1) the L1Z1X activation-window defect,
which is independent of this decision and starts with a failing engine test; (2) DIPLO-001. Still wanted
for the Hacan case: the saved game file, which says in one read whether a Hacan manual seat was offered
`transactions::available_actions` (transactions.rs:646) at all.

### Correction to the entry above, found while cross-checking, and it changes the order

The L1Z1X activation-window defect is not new and was not mine to re-name. `plans/BUG_2026-09-04_LEADER_USE_UNREACHABLE.md`
recorded that no leader could be used from the driven loop at all; `plans/LEADER-FIX-2026-09-13.md` split
the correction into three packages. LEADER-FIX-001 (deployment, unlock, component actions) is done - it is
exactly the `is_action_window` filter that produces today's symptom of "action-phase leaders work, the rest
silently do not" - and **LEADER-FIX-002, reactive combat, activation and production windows (L1Z1X, Letnev,
Sol, Hacan), is not recorded as done.**

Order, then: (1) **LEADER-FIX-002** under its own existing scope, P1 permissions and definition of done,
opening with a failing engine test that a readied I48S is offered after a system activation and settles the
infantry-for-mech swap through the normal ask/settle path; (2) DIPLO-001 onward, informed by it, since
LEADER-FIX-002's second line is Hacan trade-good spending and merging two negotiation machines underneath
half-delivered delivery is building on a broken floor.

`plans/ENGINE_DIPLOMACY_UNIFICATION.md` now says the same, with the cross-references.

## 2026-09-19 operator feedback: five UI gaps and four legality bugs, recorded and triaged

The operator drove a hand-played table and reported nine things. All are recorded in
`plans/OPERATOR_FEEDBACK_2026-09-19.md` with what was verified in code today, what done means, and the
order I intend to take them. Nothing is fixed.

Verified, so a fresh session does not re-derive it:

- **Neither viewer says anything about exploration** - `grep exploration` across `ti4-review/src/view.rs`,
  `ti4-review/src/panels.rs` and `ti4-replayer/src/gui.rs` returns nothing, while the engine has
  `exploration.rs` and content has `explores.json`. An explore is currently invisible, decided or not.
- **Attachments are shown as a count.** `view.rs:632` `pub attachments: usize`, drawn as `+N` at
  `view.rs:1624`, from `state.planet_attachments` - so *which* attachment, and what it does, is available
  and thrown away. Whether the effect applies is untested either way, which is why "maybe attachments are
  broken" stays open rather than being dismissed.
- **Seat chips print the raw id.** `view::seat_label` takes pre-made text; the chips use
  `format!("{seat} · {mode}")`. The faction is in the frame; one helper fixes chips, seat row, actor line
  and diplomacy rows at once.
- **B2/B3 are one bug class: research offers generate illegal options.** Letnev has no prerequisite waiver
  (`munitions`, `armada`), so non-Euclidean without prerequisites is an illegal offer; Jol-Nar waives
  exactly one, so a two-yellow Space Dock II is legal only if the seat had one - the arithmetic, not the
  existence of a waiver, is what has to be pinned. Start at `faction_abilities::waived_prerequisites`
  (faction_abilities.rs:163) and its test at line 1153; the *producer* of the research option list is not
  named `research_options`/`available_technologies` (both greps come back empty) and locating it is the
  first task. Related existing records: `plans/BUG-001_ANALYTICAL_RIN_UPGRADE_EXCLUSION.md`.
- **B1 (Hacan notes in transactions)** lands on top of the two-negotiation-machines problem.
  `Terms.promissory` exists, `why_illegal` reasons about notes, and
  `plans/BUG_2026-08-29_PROMISSORY_NOTE_TRANSACTION_OFFERS.md` is marked FIXED 2026-08-31 for the
  gift-priced case - so either that fix misses the operator's case or the case is on the diplomacy path.
  That is the decision `plans/ENGINE_DIPLOMACY_UNIFICATION.md` makes; the failing test should be written
  against whichever path the recording shows.
- **B4, transactions during the action phase, is recorded as a constraint at the operator's request**: not
  an action, subject to the once-per-turn limits, and honestly implemented it means a negotiation window
  nested inside an activation - which R02's machinery can nest but the transaction machine does not share.
  Every nested negotiation must be recorded with its frame stamp or forks will not replay.

Order: (1) B2+B3 as one legality package, failing engine tests first; (2) B1 with the unification shape;
(3) seat names and attachment detail; (4) deal tooltips generated from the terms, then exploration
surfacing, then policy numbers behind an honesty guard (a temperature-shaded sample is not a probability).

Single blocker for B1-B3: **the saved game**. Each is a specific offer or refusal at a specific moment, and
the recording carries the moment, phase, offer list and refusal. Until then they are well-sourced
hypotheses, not reproductions, and I would rather say that than write a test against a guess.

## 2026-09-20 later

A second operator report is in `plans/OPERATOR_FEEDBACK_2026-09-20.md` (7 items, triaged, with the
order I propose and which of them need a saved game file). Fixed on this branch since:
`09409d7` Guild Ships legality, `cf14895` technology prerequisite guard. Root cause found for the
transaction complaints: `transactions::available_actions` returns nothing while `state.diplomacy.enabled`
(deliberate, tested at `diplomacy/candidates.rs:1201`/`:1252`) and the substitute contact window is not
arriving — the first concrete case for DIPLO-001. Nothing here is committed as reviewed.

## 2026-09-21 operator bug batch opens; two engine faults fixed (F-01 Hacan agent, F-02 Maxis)

The operator asked for the `plans/BUG_PLAN_2026-09-20.md` list plus eight informal reports to be
worked independently, and waived the independent-review requirement for the duration. New branch
`wp/operator-bugs-2026-09-21`; one focused commit per fix, evidence appended to
`plans/evidence/OPERATOR_BUGS_2026-09-21.md`. The four paths that were already dirty when the batch
started (two `ti4-mlp` examples, `plans/INDEX.md`, one script) are not mine and are not staged.

**F-01 — Hacan's agent was never offered, and this is the answer to "check the commit that
supposedly fixed the leader issues".** `16f389a` (LEADER-FIX-001) added `hacanagent` to
`action_leader_delivered` and reported 44/44 leader tests green. It is green because its Hacan test
calls `use_leader` directly. The offer path is `component_actions` → `is_action_window`, which
compared the corpus window with `eq_ignore_ascii_case("during the action phase")` — and the corpus
prints `"During the action phase:"`, colon and all, for every Prophecy of Kings agent. The heroes
work because they print `"ACTION:"`. So "leaders are delivered" and "the Hacan agent is never
offered" were both true: the commit asserted the half it owned (`can this be resolved`) and nothing
asserted the half the corpus governs (`may a seat ever be asked`). Fixed by comparing the printed
window with the trailing colon removed, turning the delivered set into an array, and adding a test
that every delivered action leader's printed window is in fact an action window — the guard that
kills the class rather than the instance. Both new tests were run red first (`not on the offer list:
[]`). Also stops offering the agent when every seat is at its commodity cap, where both of its
branches would do nothing.

**F-02 — Maxis Central Control (Faunus) offered nearly nothing.** `maxis_candidates` enumerated
`&state.board`, which is written the first time a unit, a capture or a token touches a system;
untouched systems simply are not in it, and a card about "a planet that contains no units" is a card
about the systems nothing has touched. It now enumerates the map (`Galaxy`) unioned with the board —
the board still contributes for Fracture systems and for map-less unit tests — and the offered list
for a fresh table goes from the visited handful to every legal planet. Test asserts the ring really
is out of `state.board` before it asserts anything about it, then takes one of those planets through
the real ask/settle path. Eighteen sites iterate `&state.board` this way; the other seventeen are
named in the evidence file and none is called wrong without its rule text.

Checks: engine lib 1347 passed / 0 failed (was 1343 + 4 new); all `ti4-engine` integration targets
green; clippy emits nothing for `leaders.rs` or `legendary.rs`, pre-existing warnings unchanged in
count. Next in this batch, in order: the Wormhole Nexus (never placed on a map-pool board at all),
then the transaction shapes (note for note, other players' notes, action cards for notes), then the
viewer items (diplomacy terms, planet totals, dice rolls, strategy picks).

## 2026-09-21 (later) F-03: the Wormhole Nexus was not on the board at all

`malice / wormhole nexus is not on the board` was two faults, and the first is bigger than a
rendering problem. The Nexus is placed **off the hex grid** (`Galaxy::place_off_map`), and that call
lived inline at the end of `seating::build_board` — the Rust spiral. The reviewer and the replayer do
not build the spiral; they build from a captured Python map pool (`OpeningMap::PythonPool` →
`MapPool::galaxy`), as does `Save54Captured`, so on every table either viewer actually runs the tile
was never in the game: no gamma partner, no Mallice. Checked against the pools themselves — no `82`
in any of the 1000 arrangements of `out/pools/full_np8_12_final.json`. What was captured is the ring
of hexes and the Nexus is not one, so a pool cannot contain it.

The rule now lives in `seating::place_wormhole_nexus` (idempotent, PoK-gated), called by
`build_board` as before and by `ti4-training::rollout::seated` for every map family. The second half
was the viewer hiding the tile until `state.board` held it — and `state.board` is written the first
time a unit, a capture or a token touches a system, the same trap as F-02, so the tile appeared only
after the player had flown into the place they could only find by looking. `board_metadata` now lists
the two faces only when the map knows the tile (`wormhole_kinds`), and `board_view` — plus the export's
own JavaScript — draws exactly one: `82b` when `nexus_unlocked`, `82a` otherwise.

Four new tests (three map families in play; base scope gets nothing and a second placement is a
no-op; the tile draws untouched and the face follows the latch; no tile for a map that has none).
Two fixtures moved and both are explained in the evidence: the example board is 38 tiles not 37, and
the layout test's special-area expectation was wrong about scaling in a branch no frame had ever
reached.

Also committed with it: the F-01a fallout, which is the process lesson. F-01 ran the engine suite and
stopped; the workspace suite found the behavioural floors (re-baselined to v43, attributed by
bisecting — Maxis and the Nexus measured inert in that suite) and the reviewer's semantic golden
(regenerated through `TI4_REVIEW_GOLDEN_UPDATE=1`, first divergence at frame 18 where a Hacan seat is
offered Carth for the first time, byte-identical with the Nexus change removed). The same workspace
run also surfaced something not mine: `faction_differentiation` was already below its v42 floor on the
tree this batch started from. Recorded as an open item in `plans/evidence/M08-021.md`, not bisected,
not silently absorbed.

## 2026-09-21 handover: four commits, three reports closed, one design left behind

Branch `wp/operator-bugs-2026-09-21`, from `90afe71`. All four commits are on it:

| commit | the operator's words | what it was |
|---|---|---|
| `f28dcf1` | "the hacan agent is broken, never offered" | a `:` in the corpus text: `is_action_window` compared against the window without the frame's colon, so every PoK agent but Xxcha's was unofferable |
| `d878701` | (fallout of the above) | behaviour bounds v43 + the reviewer's semantic golden, attributed by bisecting each change; records a pre-existing `faction_differentiation` breach that is not ours |
| `7dbdce8` | "malice / wormhole nexus is not on the board" | the Nexus was placed only in the Rust spiral's own builder, so pool-built tables had no tile; and the view hid it until `state.board` held it |
| `847548b` | "the diplomacy offers really need better ui" | the live replayer panel rendered an offer's label and raw id; the terms were computed and shown everywhere else |

Verification: `ti4-engine` 1347, `ti4-training` 149, `ti4-review` (lib + all integration tests incl.
golden and `review_compatibility`), `ti4-sim` behaviour v43 + `map_pool`, `ti4-replayer` 60; clippy
reports nothing in the changed files. `ti4-bridge`'s 4 golden failures (missing
`crates/ti4-bridge/tests/golden/`, not in Git) and `ti4-mlp`'s `smoke_refusals` (needs
`out/vocabulary/current.json`) fail the same way before and after.

Not done, in the order I would take them:

1. **F-07, the five transaction shapes** — designed in the evidence file, including why `>` separates
   the halves and why `cp` rather than `pnc`. This closes BUG-03 and two more operator reports at
   once. It needs its own behaviour re-baseline.
2. **BUG-08**, refresh versus paying the due.
3. **Dice rolls surfacing** — check first whether the autocombat steps are in the recording at all;
   they are not read by anything outside the engine.
4. **BUG-07** (strategy pick shown unpicked), **UI-06** (planet totals), then the BUG-05/06 BLOCKED
   items once the operator's saved game arrives.

The four files that were already modified when this batch started (`ti4-mlp/examples/capture_offline_pilot.rs`,
`offline_bc.rs`, `plans/INDEX.md`, `scripts/publish_and_train_stopped_corpus.ps1`) are still
uncommitted and still not ours.

## 2026-09-21 (third): OP-04 landed, and the queue after it

`1c4a86a` — the five transaction shapes. Engine 1352 green, behaviour re-baselined to **v44** (one
metric, `faction_differentiation`, and it rose), reviewer golden re-generated with its diff read
first: first divergence at frame 19, where a Hacan seat is offered four note-for-note trades for the
first time, and 178 new options visible across 241 frames. The number worth carrying forward is that
**the sampled policy takes none of them** — the capability is for the human at the table, and the
bots' play moved only through softmax renormalization. If paper trading is wanted from the bots, that
is a training change and no amount of offer shapes will produce it.

Two of the three defects the design carried were caught by tests rather than reading: `pc` emitted
the same id once per note across the table (the pre-existing `no_deal_shape_is_written_twice` guard),
and the card-for-note shape inherited the one-good gate, which is precisely the reported table —
Hacan facing a partner holding paper and no goods — offered nothing. The third was my own test
pointing the ask the wrong way round.

Still open, dependency-free and ready for a fresh context, in the order I would take them: the
`&state.board` audit (18 sites, the Maxis fault class), BUG-08 refresh-versus-pay-the-due, OP-03 dice
rolls (check the recording before the renderer), BUG-07, UI-06 (note the golden carries tile text, so
it will move again), and UI-05's wording rule. BUG-05/06 wait on the operator's saved game and BUG-04
on their A/B/C.

## 2026-09-21 (fourth): lazy-board audit opened, and stopping mid-way

`09b7ed6` fixes the thing that caused the class rather than another instance of it: the doc comment
on `GameState::board` said "Absent entries are empty systems", which is true of units and false of
planets, tokens and anomalies, and it is the sentence a rule author reads first. The field now states
which of its three questions belongs to the board and which two belong to `Galaxy`, with Maxis named.
ti4-model 81 green; no game behaviour touched, so no fixtures moved.

Two findings worth not re-deriving: **movement is clean** (`path_from` expands via
`Galaxy::adjacent`, which is also why the F-03 Nexus tile became reachable on placement alone), and
**the class is narrower than 18 grep hits** — a rule about things in systems is right to read the
board, the fault needs a subject that can exist untouched.

Explicitly not cleared, and where to go next in this thread: the board-scanning agendas in
`agenda_effects.rs` (144, 217, 284, 1024, 1071), the legendary-planet finder past Maxis, and the
wild-token draw paths. Each is a ten-minute question — "does this rule's subject need a unit to be
there?" — and none should be marked clean without being asked.

This session ends here on context, not on blocked work. The queue after the audit is unchanged:
BUG-08, then OP-03 dice rolls (check the recording first), then BUG-07, UI-06, UI-05's wording rule.

## 2026-09-21 (fifth): the audit closed, and it found nothing live

The lazy-board audit is finished — eight sites classified in `plans/evidence/OPERATOR_BUGS_2026-09-21.md`.
One fault, `agenda_effects::system_of`, fixed (a planet's system now comes from the corpus, with the
board as the fallback for planets placed during play). **It was latent, not live**: golden byte-identical
and the behaviour suite unmoved, and the rules text for Colonial Redistribution explains why — the
agenda destroys units before it asks who controls the planet, and a planet with units has a board
entry, which is the only case where the old lookup was wrong. Exploration and wild tokens never read
the board. The class is now a one-line rule: things may read the board, places may not.

Queue unchanged and untouched by this session's remaining context: **BUG-08** (refresh offered while
paying the due is not), **BUG-09**, **OP-03** dice rolls (check the recording before the renderer),
**BUG-07**, **UI-06**, **BUG-10**, **OP-05**. Start at BUG-08 with a failing test that both answers
exist at a due; nothing here needs the operator except BUG-04's A/B/C and the two BLOCKED saved games.

## 2026-09-30 — independent review of Claude's pending main integration

Objective: answer `ASTRA_REVIEW_REQUEST_2026-09-30.md`; no migration package or milestone advanced.
Response: `plans/ASTRA_REVIEW_RESPONSE_2026-09-30.md`. Evidence and exact commands:
`plans/evidence/ASTRA-MERGE-REVIEW-2026-09-30.md`.

Branch/HEAD remain `wp/online-multiplayer` / `3f92016dabdd737212fc974d66187bbc11597aec`.
Local main remains `b1143a5b8e047dca236d07f3f9981c623b6b89d1`; both committed trees are
`54dcd09370e33d2506f4d56255f1e34147009a11`. No commit, ref movement, checkout, worktree, push,
reset, clean, prune, or historical Python access. Recommendation: **hold the push**.

Measured: all 30 behavioral seeds end cleanly; seven metrics breach v44, including every event share
and VP pace. Invasion starts/resolutions match per seed (2,120 each). `TURN_CLOSING` from `75f1d94a`
accounts for part of the denominator effect; remaining attribution is open. No rebaseline approval.
ManualControl independently reproduces a stale ask-1 submission accepted at identical ask 2; probe
exits 101 intentionally. Host pending deduplication has the same fingerprint-only identity defect
by inspection. App/live tests pass (21 + 9); reviewer identity-hook test passes (1). Stage-1 exact
one-seed diagnostic has 399 decisions and zero weights; the reference plan's 16-seed sample has
6,752 decisions, zero errors, and 32,329 named nonzero weights. Hashing did not remove named schema-4
weights. Preserve that test contract and repair its learning fixture.

Working tree intentionally remains dirty. All inherited changes were preserved: 16 staged bridge
goldens; capture_offline_pilot/offline_bc; app.rs and app/live tests; review board/decision tests;
rollout.rs formatting; INDEX.md; publish_and_train_stopped_corpus.ps1; the review request, two resume
psd1 files, and target-cuda-repack/. Review additions are only three diagnostic examples named
`astra_*_20260930.rs` in ti4-sim/ti4-training/ti4-replayer, response/evidence docs, this append, and
ignored `out/astra-review-20260930/` logs/hash manifest. Existing fixtures and fixes are still not in
either committed tree. The full status/diff is preserved under that ignored evidence directory.

Next safe action: scope the typed live-choice instance fix across submission/delegation and host
pending delivery, keeping replay's shape hash stable; retain the red stale-click probe. Then finish
behavior attribution and fixture/golden repairs as specified in the response, commit scoped changes,
and qualify the exact forward-integrated candidate with `cargo test --workspace -j 4 --no-fail-fast`.
No full workspace rerun or overall 127-commit/security sign-off was performed by this reviewer.
All review-owned commands completed; no background worker was left running. Read this checkpoint,
the request, response, evidence, and current Git state before resuming.

## 2026-10-04 — BF-COMBAT-ORIGIN: the branch builds again

Objective: finish the `HitOrigin` combat-origin seam the inherited base-faction wave had left
half-installed, make `ti4-engine` green, register the decision sites the wave created, re-validate
the base-faction ledger and the behaviour point, and commit the result without touching the separate
ML session's work. Evidence and exact commands: `plans/evidence/BF-COMBAT-ORIGIN.md`.

Inherited state: `wp/base-factions` at `a13f185b`, 21 modified paths, `cargo check -p ti4-engine
--all-targets` red — `absorb_hits_seeing_with` had gained a `HitOrigin` parameter and two call
sites (`game.rs:256`, one `combat.rs` test) had not been updated.

Done and committed on this package:

- Space-cannon absorption passes `HitOrigin::UnitAbility`. A space cannon hit is not a combat-roll
  hit, and Naaz's Eidolon Maximum is defined against exactly that distinction.
- `SHIP_MOVED` now carries the traversed `path`; that payload key is the producer for Muaat's
  breakthrough, which reads `event.text("path")`.
- `technology::bf_f3_tests::a_module_waiver_requires_a_selected_payment_and_is_paid_once` no longer
  hardcodes waiver index `0`. `research_waiver_offers` numbers only tables that register a waiver
  hook, and the wave registered Yin's Brother Omar, so the test's own hook moved to index `1` and
  the test paid the wrong waiver. The index is now derived from `research_waiver_offers`, as the
  production caller does. No fixture was regenerated.
- `decision_delivery_inventory.rs` registers `strategy_cards.rs::resolve_research` (2 choices,
  `ObservedVia("strategy_cards.rs::ask")`), `yssaril.rs::action_card_draw_requested` (1,
  `ObservedHere`), and the two Yssaril observed asks.
- The three clippy warnings the wave introduced are fixed; the 18 pre-existing `ti4-engine` and 1
  `ti4-model` warnings are untouched. `cargo fmt -p ti4-engine` touched only files already inside the
  wave.

Measured: `cargo test -p ti4-engine -q --no-fail-fast -j 8` → 1928 + 1 + 4 + 5 passed, 0 failed,
1 ignored (`factions::tests::print_faction_ledger`), doctests clean. `cargo test -p ti4-sim --lib`
→ 51/0/1. `cargo check --release -p ti4-policy -p ti4-sim --all-targets` → exit 0, so the changed
engine API does not break its downstream consumers. Twelve concurrent 200-seated faction soaks
(one process per faction, 32-core host, 7 m 06 s wall) → 2,400 games with replay comparison,
**0 failures**, run twice with identical results. The six-original-faction 30-seed diagnostic is
**identical to the recorded `c5632448` point on all ten metrics** (`vp_pace 0.472222`,
`share_SHIP_MOVED 0.046439`, …): the wave is behaviour-neutral for the original six. Ledger:
arborec 12/12, argent 12/13, ghost 12/12, mentak 12/12, muaat 13/13, naalu 11/13, naaz 11/13,
saar 12/13, sardakk 12/12, winnu 10/11, yin 9/11, yssaril 10/12 — **136/147**. The denominator
moved 145 → 147 because the wave registered further base-faction assets, so 136/147 is not
comparable with the earlier 133/145.

Decisions: commit the inherited engine wave rather than only this package's edits, because a green
HEAD requires it and the wave is one interdependent unit; stage `game.rs` partially so the other
session's round-income experiment (`Game::with_round_income`, `STATUS_INCOME_TRADE_GOODS`) stays
uncommitted — verified safe because `git show HEAD:crates/ti4-training/src/rollout.rs` has no
`with_round_income` reference. Environment note for later sessions: the pinned
`out/libtorch-2.9.1-cpu/lib` has no `include` directory, so exporting `LIBTORCH` invalidates the
cached `torch-sys` fingerprint and a fresh C++ build then fails on `torch/torch.h`; unset `LIBTORCH`
for debug work and set it only for the release diagnostics that need it. A whole-workspace debug
build is not available in this environment right now.

Not cleared: **no independent review was run** — no review peer was available, and these changes are
self-reviewed; tier C/D review is still owed for the wave as a whole. Eleven base-faction assets
remain unclaimed (`argentagent`, `naaluagent-te`, `naalucommander`, `naaz_voltron`, `naazbt`,
`saarbt`, `winnuhero`, `yinhero`, `yinbt`, `yssarilagent`, `yssarilbt`). The Naaz Eidolon change is
soaked but not asserted by any fixture. The five metrics outside the retired behaviour bounds are
unchanged and still await a re-baselining decision.

Working tree after the commit: intentionally still dirty. Uncommitted and untouched: the `game.rs`
round-income experiment, `crates/ti4-mlp/**`, `crates/ti4-policy/**`, `crates/ti4-training/**`,
`crates/ti4-replayer/**`, `crates/ti4-review/**`, `scripts/`, `plans/INDEX.md`,
`target-cuda-repack/`. No command in this package wrote to the historical Python reference.

Next safe action: add the missing Naaz fixture — one ground combat where a `HitOrigin::UnitAbility`
hit is suppressed by Eidolon immunity while a `HitOrigin::CombatRoll` hit is not — then claim
`naaz_voltron` if the Voltron unit behaviour the wave implemented is real. After that the remaining
base-faction gaps are the eight leaders/breakthroughs already listed in the wave-D queue. Obtain a
tier C review of this commit before extending the wave further.

## 2026-10-04 — BF-NAAZ-EIDOLON: the Eidolon Maximum is not offered a hit it cannot take

Objective: close the one Eidolon Maximum clause that BF-COMBAT-ORIGIN had made possible but had not
asserted — "It cannot be assigned hits from unit abilities" — and claim `naaz_voltron` only if the
behaviour turned out to be real. Evidence and exact commands: `plans/evidence/BF-NAAZ-EIDOLON.md`.

Inherited state: `wp/base-factions` at `920c852c`, tree intentionally dirty (the other session's
`game.rs` round-income experiment plus the ML/replayer paths).

Done and committed on this package:

- Fixtures first. Three tests in `factions::naaz::tests`: an ability hit against a Maximum plus a
  fighter, an ability hit against a Maximum alone, and a combat-roll hit against the same position
  with sustain declined. Two of them failed against `920c852c`; the combat-roll control passed.
- The failure was real, not a missing test. `offer_sustain` ran before the eligibility filter, so the
  engine asked the player to spend the Maximum's SUSTAIN DAMAGE on a hit that could never have been
  assigned to it; accepting cancelled the hit and damaged the Maximum instead of 15.2a discarding it.
- `combat.rs` now has one predicate, `assignable_to_hit`, used by **both** the sustain offer and the
  casualty filter. `offer_sustain` takes `origin: HitOrigin` and offers only units that could take
  the hit — including the `planet:<id>` branch that lets a planet-standing Maximum sustain next to a
  real ship. Four existing `offer_sustain` tests pass `HitOrigin::CombatRoll`.

Measured: `cargo test -p ti4-engine --lib naaz::tests` 29/0/0. `cargo test -p ti4-engine -q
--no-fail-fast -j 4` → **1931 + 1 + 4 + 5 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored**, doctests clean (1928 →
1931 is this package's three fixtures). `cargo fmt -p ti4-engine -- --check` clean. `cargo clippy -p
ti4-engine --all-targets -j 4` → 14 lib / 18 lib-test (14 duplicates) / 1 `ti4-model`, identical to
the counts recorded for `920c852c`; nothing points at `naaz.rs`. Twelve concurrent 200-seated faction
soaks run alongside the six-faction diagnostic (13 processes, 32 cores, 415 s wall) → 2,400 games,
**0 failures**. `rebaseline_behavior` reproduces the recorded point **exactly on all ten metrics**,
so the shared-path change is behaviour-neutral for the original six. `cargo test -p ti4-sim --lib`
51/0/1. Ledger unchanged at **136/147**, `naaz 11/13`.

Decisions: **`naaz_voltron` and `naazbt` stay unclaimed.** The immunity is real and now tested, but
the card is not implemented end to end: produced hits (Ambush, Impulse Core, Devotion) and the
bombardment / space-cannon-defence paths still label their hits `HitOrigin::CombatRoll`, effect
placement of mechs is not gated, and a captured Maximum is not re-typed on release. Claiming the unit
would read as coverage of the card. Environment: nineteen `grep` processes left running by earlier
sessions (oldest four days) were scanning `out/` and `target-cuda-repack/`; while they ran,
`cargo test -p ti4-engine --lib` failed twice with `rustc-LLVM ERROR: out of memory` /
`STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN`. Killing them fixed the build with no code change, and they were the
reason a plain recursive `grep` looked endless — use `git grep` in this repository.

Not cleared: no independent review for this package or for `920c852c` (tier C/D still owed). No
fixture pins a planet-standing Maximum joining its system's space combat through a real combat window,
even though `ships_of` and `offer_sustain` both implement it. Eleven base-faction assets remain
unclaimed. The five metrics outside the retired behaviour bounds are unchanged.

Working tree after this commit: intentionally still dirty — the `game.rs` round-income experiment,
`crates/ti4-mlp/**`, `crates/ti4-policy/**`, `crates/ti4-training/**`, `crates/ti4-replayer/**`,
`crates/ti4-review/**`, `scripts/`, `plans/INDEX.md`, `plans/evidence/BF-ghost.md`,
`target-cuda-repack/`. No command in this package wrote to the historical Python reference.

Next safe action: decide which hit producers are "unit abilities" and label them
(`ProducedHits`, `invasion.rs` bombardment and space-cannon defence), with fixtures for at least
Ambush and one bombardment case — the remaining half of BF-naaz hook request 6 and the precondition
for claiming `naaz_voltron`. Obtain a tier C review of `920c852c` and this commit before extending
the wave further.
