# Handover — Stage-1: three confounds found, hybrid screen concluded, reward control in flight

Date: 2026-09-06 (Europe/Vienna). Supersedes the execution plan in
`plans/archive/HANDOVER_2026-09-06_STAGE1_HYBRID_CORRECTED.md` (its *measurement conventions and artifact
inventory remain valid and authoritative*; its remaining execution sequence does not — see §3).

## 0. Read this first, in this order

1. This file.
2. `plans/STAGE1_TRAINING_TECHNIQUES.md` — measurement conventions, tool table, prior recipes.
   **Contains one error corrected in §7 below; fix it before citing it.**
3. `plans/SITUATION_REPORT_2026-09-05_STAGE1_BC_FAILURE.md` — the escalation and its five questions.
4. `plans/archive/HANDOVER_2026-09-06_STAGE1_HYBRID_CORRECTED.md` — artifact inventory, invalid-artifact
   list, eval commands. Still correct on all of that.
5. `plans/STAGE2_TRANSFERABLE_LESSONS.md` — the noise floor. Non-negotiable background.

## 1. Objective and where we actually stand

Target: **≥95.00% greedy clearance AND ≤0.50% greedy any-waste**, overall, reported per faction.
Convention: clearance = `clearance_eval --temperature 0.001 --seeds 600` on the **Validation** pool
(600 seeds × 6 rotations = 21,600 seat-games); waste = `build_positive_corpus --temperatures 0.001
--seeds 600` on the **Train** pool. Never quote the in-training report table for either — it is
self-play at the acting temperature (T=0.25) and the sampled→greedy gap has been observed as large
as +8.7pp on one arm and +3.8pp on another.

**Best artifact remains `out/checkpoints/blank-waste-mine-p5/checkpoint-59540`: 93.40% ±0.33
clearance, 2.31% any-waste, 91.36% clear+zero, all six factions >90%.** Nothing produced since has
beaten it on any axis. It is 1,600 PPO updates from blank, waste-penalty 5 present from update 0,
single uninterrupted invocation, **under the pre-correction reward** (see §2.3 — this matters).

## 2. The three confounds (the main result of this session)

Every experiment that started *from* `checkpoint-59540` has regressed. That was being read as a
property of the methods (PPO continuation, BC, PPO+BC hybrid). It is at least partly an artifact of
three independent discontinuities, two of which were previously unrecognised.

### 2.1 Optimizer state is not persisted (confirmed, affects every continuation)

`ti4_mlp::bundle` writes an **inference** bundle. `INFERENCE_FILES` (`crates/ti4-mlp/src/bundle.rs`)
is a closed 5-name list — `trunk`, `readout`, `value`, `embedding`, `slots` — and an unrecognised
name is a hard error. **No Adam moments, no step counter, no RNG state.** Every `ppo_update`
invocation from a checkpoint therefore starts with `m=v=0` on a converged policy, where late-run
Adam moments encode the recent gradient geometry. This is the supervisor's leading hypothesis and
it is structurally confirmed; its *magnitude* is still unmeasured (see §4).

### 2.2 Rollout-seed replay (confirmed, affects the `-continued` run specifically)

`ppo_update.rs:1221`: `let base = seed_base + SEEDS_PER_UPDATE * update` where `update` is the index
**within the current invocation** and `SEEDS_PER_UPDATE = 16`. A restart with the same `--seed-base`
therefore replays the maps the earlier run already trained on. The source documents this hazard
itself at `ppo_update.rs:76-78`:

> "A run consumes `SEEDS_PER_UPDATE` seeds per update, so a later run that starts here replays the
> same maps and the same openings an earlier one already trained on. Fresh weights on stale seeds
> measure how well the policy does on games it has seen, which is not the question."

`out/blank-waste-p5-continued-2.log` line 3 reads `seeds 650000000..` — the *same* base as the
original run. So the widely-cited regression result (91.24% / 5.19%) is confounded by **both** 2.1
and 2.2 and should not be used as evidence about PPO continuation.

The `hybrid-guided-*` arms used `--seed-base 1700000000/1800000000`, so they are seed-clean. They
remain subject to 2.1 and 2.3.

**To continue a run's seed stream correctly**, set `--seed-base <original_base + 16 × updates_done>`.
For a branch at update 1200 off base 650000000 that is `650019200`.

### 2.3 The reward changed after `checkpoint-59540` was trained (confirmed, affects every arm in the previous handover)

Compare log headers:

```text
59540's own run:      potential   expansion 2 | unit 1 | conjunctive 0 | clear bonus 22
every current run:    potential   planets+systems 2 | capacity+infantry 1 | conjunctive 0 | clear bonus 22
```

`crates/ti4-training/src/reward.rs` (+76 lines) and `crates/ti4-policy/src/progress.rs` (+29) carry
**uncommitted** changes replacing the one-unit proxy with the four-component measure — the previous
handover's "Critical correction history §2", made *after* 59540 existed.

**Consequence: the entire `hybrid-guided-*` experiment continued a policy trained under reward X
while optimising reward Y.** A policy at an optimum of X will be pulled off it by gradient on Y and
should be expected to look worse on both metrics while it moves. This is a sufficient alternative
explanation for the "universal post-59540 regression" and it was not in the supervisor's picture.

**It also invalidates the A/B/C branch experiment as specified** in the supervisor's Step 1 if run
from 59540: the branch point predates the reward it would be trained under. Any A/B/C must branch
from a checkpoint produced under *current* source.

## 3. The hybrid screen: concluded early, with its result

Seed 1 ran to completion (both arms, 100 updates, all four checkpoints each, fully evaluated).
Seed 2's control completed; seed 2's hybrid was stopped at update ~15 and **seed 3 was never
started**, because the supervisor review reprioritised onto the confounds above and the GPU is
serial.

Greedy, Validation clearance / Train any-waste / clear+zero:

| update | control s1 | aux s1 | Δ clear | Δ waste |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| u0 (shared) | 93.40 / 2.31 / 91.36 | *(same)* | — | — |
| u25 | 92.28 / 4.28 / 89.06 | 91.80 / 2.62 / 89.66 | −0.48 | −1.66 |
| u50 | 91.65 / 4.78 / 87.81 | 93.77 / 5.98 / 88.49 | +2.12 | +1.20 |
| u75 | 90.78 / 6.78 / 86.14 | 91.41 / 2.51 / 89.97 | +0.63 | −4.27 |
| u100 | **81.66** / 9.19 / 77.98 | 90.22 / 4.30 / 87.25 | **+8.56** | −4.89 |

Reading, stated conservatively:

- **Both arms degrade from baseline throughout.** No checkpoint in either arm beats 59540 on
  clearance; only aux-u75 (2.51%) approaches its waste.
- The decision standard (Δclear > 0 **and** Δwaste < 0) is met at u75 and u100 only.
- **The u100 margin is mostly control collapse, not aux improvement** (control falls 90.78 → 81.66).
  The honest description of the auxiliary's effect is *damage resistance*, not improvement — which
  is consistent with its design intent as an anti-forgetting anchor.
- **Most deltas are inside the noise floor.** Within the aux arm, adjacent checkpoints swing
  +1.97 / −2.36 / −1.19 pp. Three of the four Δclear values sit inside that band. Per
  `STAGE2_TRANSFERABLE_LESSONS.md` the table training floor is 1.54pp (σ ≈ 0.80pp), per-faction up
  to 5.39pp.
- **This is one seed.** The supervisor's requirement is 5 paired seeds to screen and 8 to claim a
  ~1pp effect. Seed 1 alone cannot support a conclusion in either direction.
- Everything above is additionally subject to confound 2.3.

**Collapse-gate history (for the record):** aux s1 struck at u25 on *both* conditions (overall
91.80% < 92.5%; sol −2.53pp, xxcha −5.97pp vs their own 59540 starts). At u50 the overall recovered
to 93.77% and sol/xxcha recovered to −0.19/−0.84; a *different* faction (l1z1x, −2.36pp) was flagged.
I did **not** stop the run: the handover's wording is "if the second consecutive checkpoint
**confirms it**", the section is titled *Collapse gates*, and the original strike's causes had all
reversed while overall clearance rose above baseline. A strict literal reading ("either condition,
twice consecutively") would have stopped it. **This was a judgement call — flag it to the owner if
re-running the screen, and tighten the gate's wording either way.**

## 4. The optimizer-reset experiment (designed, not yet run)

The supervisor's A/B/C, adapted for confound 2.3. **Do not branch from 59540.** Branch from a
checkpoint produced under current source — the run described in §5 is producing exactly these, every
100 updates.

Cheapest decisive form (**A vs C only**; B is a serialization-correctness check worth doing only
*after* A vs C shows a gap, since implementing full-state resume is the expensive part):

- **A** — the uninterrupted run itself, evaluated at update *N+K*.
- **C** — from A's update-*N* checkpoint, a fresh invocation of *K* updates, weights-only, with
  `--seed-base <base + 16×N>` so its rollout seeds exactly match A's updates *N..N+K*.

With seeds matched and weights identical at the branch point, **the only difference is Adam state**.
If C ≪ A, confound 2.1 is quantified and every continuation result to date needs reinterpretation.

If that gap is real, then implementing resume is justified. It cannot go inside the bundle (closed
file list, §2.1) — write a **sibling** artifact, e.g. `<out>/resume-<N>/`, holding Adam m/v/step,
the update counter, the rollout-seed position, and CPU/CUDA RNG state, and add `--resume <path>`.
Note `--entropy-final` defaults to `1.0`, which makes `scale` identically 1.0, so **no entropy
annealing has been active in any run to date** — I verified this and it is *not* a contributing
factor, contrary to my initial hypothesis.

## 5. What is running right now

```text
process   ppo_update.exe, single CUDA job
arm       p5 fixed, from blank, CORRECTED reward   <-- the control that should have been run first
out       out/checkpoints/blank-corrected-p5
log       out/blank-corrected-p5.log  (+ .err.log)
cmd       --bundle out/checkpoints/blank-fa3d6f9-shared --stage 1 --rounds 1
          --temperature 0.25 --movement-entropy 0.05 --seed-base 650000000
          --waste-penalty 5 --updates 2050 --report-every 100 --device cuda
progress  ~update 333/2050 at handover  (~3.8 s/update, so ~1h50m total)
```

**Purpose: isolate confound 2.3.** Same recipe and same seed base as the run that produced 59540;
the *only* difference is the corrected reward. Therefore:

- lands near **93%** → corrected reward is sound; 59540 is reproducible; p8 (§6) was simply too
  strong. Next lever is a gentler penalty or the p5→p8 ramp.
- lands near **87%** → **the corrected reward itself costs ~6pp**, which would be the session's most
  important finding and would call the correction itself into question.

It also yields clean under-current-source branch points for §4, and a fresh champion candidate.

## 6. The p8 arm (run, stopped, negative — and confounded by my own design error)

`out/checkpoints/blank-corrected-p8`, 15 checkpoints, stopped at ~update 1500 of 2050.

Greedy at u1400 (`checkpoint-43240`): **87.18% ±0.45 clearance, 3.39% any-waste, 85.35% clear+zero**
— worse than 59540 on all three; xxcha collapsed to 74.47%. In-training table was flat across
u1000→u1500 (83.62 → 83.90 → 83.86 → 83.14 → 83.34 → 83.42), i.e. plateaued, which is why it was
stopped rather than run to 2050.

**Design error, stated plainly: I changed two variables at once** (penalty 5→8 *and* old→corrected
reward), so this run cannot distinguish "p8 too strong" from "corrected reward worse". The
supervisor specified a p5 control arm first; I skipped it to chase the target. §5 is the repair.

One finding does survive the confound: **p8-from-blank does not fail the way p8-retrofit failed.**
Tactical activity held at 3.000/seat (in-training 2.981 vs p5's 3.010 at a comparable point), where
the retrofit collapsed it 3.510 → 1.873. So "solve waste by not activating" is *not* what went wrong
here, and the from-blank-vs-retrofit distinction still stands. `tactical/seat` must stay a mandatory
diagnostic on every waste-penalty arm.

## 7. Correction to `plans/STAGE1_TRAINING_TECHNIQUES.md` — apply this

That file states the historical champion reached "94.97%/1.11% waste". **The 1.11% is wrong in that
context.** It comes from `STAGE2_RUN1.md`'s crossplay table — 720 seat-games, 4 rounds, stage-2
context — not the stage-1 greedy 21,600-seat-game any-waste convention. I conflated two different
measurements. What the record actually supports:

| claim | value | source |
|---|---|---|
| best stage-1 clearance ever | 94.97% | `best-94.97_r2-epoch22`, `STAGE2_RUN1.md:29` |
| its any-waste at this convention | **never measured** | — |
| best any-waste ever | 1.46% @ 93.23% clearance | `xxcha-best-99.22_waste-p8`, `CHAMPIONS.md:25` |

**95% / 0.5% jointly has never been achieved in this project's records** — the two bests are
different checkpoints and neither meets both bars. Note also that 93.40% (59540) vs 94.97%
(historical best) is a 1.57pp gap against a **1.54pp training noise floor**: on the joint objective
59540 is plausibly the best policy the project has ever had. Treat 95/0.5 as a new frontier, not a
regression to recover.

## 8. Tooling added this session

`scripts/eval_arm.ps1` — evaluates every published checkpoint of a run at the acceptance convention:
clearance + waste + drift, one named evidence log each, skips work already done, and **reads update
numbers from each manifest's `source` field** rather than inferring them from directory names (those
are Adam-step counts; 992→u25, 1936→u50, 2860→u75, 3792→u100 for a 100-update run).

```powershell
./scripts/eval_arm.ps1 -RunDir out/checkpoints/<run> -Arm <aux|control|...> -Suffix <s1|...> [-Updates 25,50]
```

28 evidence logs exist as `out/eval-*.log`. All CPU-only, so they run beside a GPU job — but they
**do** slow its rollouts materially (observed 15.3 → 24.5 s/update on the hybrid arm). Prefer
running them between GPU jobs when the schedule allows.

## 9. Recommended next actions

1. **Wait for §5 to finish** (~1h50m from its start) and evaluate `blank-corrected-p5` checkpoints
   greedily. This is the fork in the road; do not start anything else on the GPU before it lands.
2. **Run the A-vs-C optimizer test (§4)** from a `blank-corrected-p5` branch point. Cheap (~one
   short run), and it either quantifies confound 2.1 or clears it.
3. **Only then** choose the waste strategy: gentler fixed penalty, p5→p8 ramp, or — if scalar
   penalties keep failing to move the Pareto frontier — the supervisor's constrained/Lagrangian
   formulation, with the cost estimated over a rolling multi-update buffer (at the target,
   96 × 0.005 ≈ 0.48 waste-positive games per update, so per-update dual estimates are Bernoulli
   noise).
4. **Do not resume the hybrid screen** without first deciding the confound-2.3 question; and if
   resumed, budget 5 paired seeds minimum (8 to claim ~1pp), full-length runs with
   checkpoint-selection as part of the recipe, not 100-update stubs.
5. **Per-faction handling**: put it in *selection* (e.g. `min_f LCB95(clearance_f)` subject to the
   waste constraint) and in per-faction loss balancing, **not** six reward functions. Per-faction
   noise is up to 5.39pp, so single-run faction readings are near-meaningless as feedback.

## 10. Working-tree state — preserve, do not reset

14 modified files (`git status --short`), all uncommitted, HEAD = `c7c4e23`
(`OBS-012: decision completeness qualification`). These are **other people's in-flight work plus the
reward correction**; do not `reset`, `checkout`, `clean`, or commit them without checking:

```text
 M crates/ti4-content/src/galaxy.rs        M crates/ti4-mlp/src/positive_corpus.rs

```

`crates/ti4-policy/src/critic.rs` in particular is an **unclaimed** edit (adds per-exploration-card
identity facts); neither this session nor `ti4-engine-rs-70` made it, it was flagged to the owner,
and its disposition is still unknown. Untracked: the four `plans/*.md` from this and yesterday's
session, `scripts/eval_arm.ps1`, and the pre-existing `sample.html` / `sample.ti4review.json`.

**Environment.** Binaries are dynamically linked against whichever libtorch was on `PATH` at build
time; the release examples were built against **cu128**. Mixing in the cpu-only libtorch produces
`c10.dll: cannot open shared object file`. Always:

```powershell
$env:LIBTORCH = "$PWD/out/libtorch-2.9.1-cu128"
$env:LIBTORCH_BYPASS_VERSION_CHECK = "1"
$env:PATH = "$env:LIBTORCH/lib;$env:PATH"
$env:GIT_COMMIT = (git rev-parse HEAD)
```

**Shared checkout, single GPU.** Other sessions (`ti4-engine-rs-70`, and at least one unattributed
editor) work in this same tree. Check `tasklist` for `ppo_update.exe` before starting a CUDA job,
and use distinct `--out` paths. `out/` is gitignored, so `plans/` is the only durable record.
