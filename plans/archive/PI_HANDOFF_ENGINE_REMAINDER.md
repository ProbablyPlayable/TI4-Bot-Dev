Written 2026-08-31. Supersedes `plans/archive/HANDOFF_ENGINE_COMPLETION.md`, whose numbers are stale.
Companions: `plans/ENGINE_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`, `engine-rules-audit.md`.

Branch `wp/engine-completion`, worktree `D:/Projects/ti4-engine-work`, head `4422407`.
**It has not been merged back into `wp/r01-review-viewer-contract`.** Do that first or you will
redo the card content.

## Start here

```
cargo run -p ti4-engine --example remaining         # every gap, by name, from the code
cargo run -p ti4-engine --example coverage_report   # the counts
```

Both read the modules' own `unimplemented` helpers, so neither can drift the way this document
can. If they disagree with anything below, they are right.

## What is left

| area | left | items |
|---|---|---|
| relics | 6 of 24 | `titanprototype` `neuraloop` `dominusorb` `emphidia` `thalnos` `heartofixth` |
| laws | 13 | listed below |
| exploration | 7 of 80 | `frln1` `frln2` `frln3` `ed1` `ed2` `ion` `mirage` |
| leaders | 2 | `xxchahero` `jolnaragent` |
| breakthroughs | 1 of 6 | `jolnarbt` |
| action cards | **0** | done |
| agendas / objectives / secrets / faction abilities / reaction windows | **0** | done |

Everything else in the six-faction scope is implemented.

## The order I would do it in

### 1. The dice cluster — three items, one piece of shared work

`thalnos`, `crown_of_thalnos` and `heartofixth` all modify dice that have been rolled and not yet
applied. **The infrastructure already exists and was built for exactly this.**

- `GameState::reroll_staging` holds a `RerollSet` whose faces are still mutable.
- `combat::open_reroll_windows` (combat.rs:283) opens the window; `combat::staged_hits` recomputes
  hits from whatever faces survive it.
- `dice::Roll::rerolled` records *which* positions were replaced. That field exists specifically
  because Crown of Thalnos says "destroy each of their units that did not produce a hit **with its
  reroll**", which is unanswerable from the faces alone. Its doc comment says so.

So Thalnos and Crown of Thalnos are: bind into the existing window, reroll the chosen dice, then
destroy units whose *rerolled* dice missed. Thalnos also applies +1 to the results.

`heartofixth` is the one with real scope in it. "After **any** die is rolled" — and only space
combat and space cannon stage their rolls today. Bombardment, anti-fighter barrage and the gravity
rift roll and apply immediately. Either extend staging to those sites, or implement the card for
the staged sites and record the limitation in `engine-rules-audit.md`. **Do not** implement it
silently for two sites and let the ledger imply four.

### 2. The payment-decider cluster — three items, one shape

`jolnarbt`, `jolnaragent` and `xxchahero` all interrupt a payment to ask a question.

- `jolnarbt`: exhaust a technology-specialty planet instead of spending resources; you must then
  research a technology of that colour.
- `jolnaragent`: remove any number of infantry, each reducing the resources spent by 1.
- `xxchahero`: when exhausting planets, combine resources and influence and treat the total as both.

All three land on `production::payment_faces`, which is the single place a planet's spendable value
is computed and is already substituted through `planet_value_now`. Change it once and every
spending path sees it. `production::pay` already takes a `Table`, so the decider is in reach.

Note the overlap with `plans/archive/BUG_2026-08-29_PRODUCTION_COMBINED_PAYMENT.md` — read it before
touching `payment_faces`; you may fix both at once.

`grant_chosen_technology` in relics.rs is the "ask which technology, gain it, no prerequisites"
helper. `jolnarbt` wants the colour-filtered form, which its `colour: Option<&str>` parameter
already provides.

### 3. Exploration — five of the seven are already written elsewhere

- `ed1` and `ed2` are **Enigmatic Device**, the same card as the relic implemented in `70ca02b`.
  Same text, same six resources, same `grant_chosen_technology`. Lift the arm.
- `frln1` `frln2` `frln3` are one card three times: produce 1 unit here, and influence may be spent
  as if it were resources. `production` already models a `Spend` kind; this is a substitution at the
  same `payment_faces` site as cluster 2. Do it after that one.
- `mirage` places a planet token and grants its card. `Planet::is_placed_during_play` already exists
  for exactly this class.
- `ion` is a wormhole that flips sides. `Galaxy` already carries `wormholes_off` and
  `wormholes_all_linked` — check them before deciding anything is missing.

### 4. Relics — the remaining four

- `emphidia`: two halves. Explore a planet after a tactical action (easy — `exploration` is
  complete), and a status-phase victory point for controlling the Tomb. The Tomb arrives from the
  exploration deck, so do this after `mirage`; they share the placed-planet path.
- `dominusorb`: move and transport units from systems containing your command token. A movement
  legality change, in `transit`.
- `neuraloop`: replace a revealed public objective with a random one from any deck. Note the sting —
  a *secret* objective drawn this way becomes a public one. Check `objectives::scoreable` reads it
  as public.
- `titanprototype`: choose a player; they may spend 3 resources to place a structure, or else gain a
  trade good. It is the only relic that asks a decider other than its owner. `Table::ask` addresses
  a seat, so this works, but the offer must go to the chosen player.

### 5. Laws — 13 enacted but not enforced

They vote and enact correctly today; nothing reads them once in play.

**Four are ownable cards with a discard trigger** — `committee` (choose the elected player, no
vote), `arbiter` (swap a strategy card at end of strategy phase), `minister_peace` (end the active
player's turn), `minister_war` (remove a command token, then take an additional action). All four
follow `holds_ministry`, which exists and already has four callers to copy.

**Two are victory points that move** — `shard_of_the_throne` (on winning a combat against the
owner) and `crown_of_emphidia` (on taking a planet in the owner's home system). Both give a point
to the taker *and* take one from the previous owner. Get the losing half right; a version that only
grants is worse than not implementing it at all.

**The rest**: `revolution` (destroy a non-fighter ship after researching / exhaust planets per
technology), `classified` (a scored secret becomes public), `minister_industry` (PRODUCTION when
placing a space dock), `checks` (give away your chosen strategy card / ready only 3 planets),
`nexus` (nexus wormholes off, or a gamma token on Mecatol), `warrant` (play with secrets revealed),
`crown_of_thalnos` (see cluster 1).

`laws::active(state, alias)` is the predicate entry point. `laws::enforced_aliases()` is the ledger
— **add to it in the same commit as the predicate and its caller, never before.**

## The one defect class to watch for

Seven times in this work the bug was the same shape: **a registry that had drifted from the code
that dispatches from it, guarded by a test asserting something weaker than the invariant.**

- `action_cards::unimplemented` returned every card and never consulted `effect_for`; its guard
  asserted `all.len() > 50`, which held either way.
- Public objectives were counted from `registered_aliases` while the scorer also reads `cost_of`.
- The relic ledger counted `registered_aliases().len() + 1` — a bonus for a card already in the
  list, and no source filter, so it reported more relics than the corpus it was counting.
- The breakthrough count was the literal `2`, with a comment explaining that only two were read
  anywhere in the engine. True when written; it was 5 by the time anyone looked. (Fixed here.)
- Five passive relics were nearly offered as component actions, because `available_actions` offered
  from `registered_aliases` rather than from the arms of `use_relic`.
- Four laws sat in `enforced_aliases` with predicates and no callers.

**Before trusting any count, grep the helper for a caller.** A number in a report is not evidence
that the code path runs.

The mirror of this: **grep the model before declaring anything blocked.** `Galaxy::wormholes_off`,
`System::is_scar`, `GameState::strategy_card_goods` and the whole reroll-staging system were all
built and uncalled. At least one of the items above is less work than it looks for this reason.

## Verification

```
RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo clippy -p ti4-engine --all-targets   # CI runs this
cargo test -p ti4-engine                                           # 1,058 green at 4422407
cargo test -p ti4-sim                                              # 52 green; includes the gate
```

`-D warnings` is not optional. The branch was failing it on seven pre-existing clippy errors that a
laxer local invocation hid. They are fixed at `4422407` — keep it that way.

**`cargo test -p ti4-sim` needs `out/pools/full_np8_12_holdout.json`,** which is untracked and lives
only in the main checkout. Copy it into your worktree, or `fixture_capture_is_deterministic` fails
for a reason that has nothing to do with your change.

### The behavioural gate

`crates/ti4-sim/src/behavior.rs` runs two checks: a *value* gate (metrics within recorded bounds)
and a stricter *protocol-integrity* gate (the recorded bounds must equal what the tree recomputes).
The second is why the baseline moves even when every value is still in range.

Re-baseline with `cargo run -p ti4-sim --example rebaseline_behavior`, which prints old against new
and changes nothing by itself. Record every move in `plans/evidence/M08-021.md` with its cause.
Currently **v17**.

Adding a new event type lengthens the event stream and dilutes all six `share_*` metrics by one
uniform factor, while leaving `vp_pace`, `score_spread`, `faction_differentiation` and `completion`
untouched. A real change in play moves the latter. When you move the baseline, say which of the two
you are looking at — that distinction is the only thing keeping the gate meaningful.

## Things that will bite

- **Strategy cards key on `id`, not `alias`.** The only content category that does. Cost a
  debugging round on `investments`.
- **Expired fixtures.** Five tests died during this work because their premise was "the engine does
  not implement X" and then it did. When a test fails right after you implement something, check
  whether it was asserting the gap before you assume you broke it.
- **`fleet::enforce_everywhere` exists and is deliberately uncalled.** Wiring it into `Game::step`
  broke 8 fixtures. It needs its own reviewed change, not a drive-by.
- **A duplicate `AGENDA_PHASE_BEGAN` emission is known and deliberately unfixed** (`emit` plus
  `mirror_timing_log`), because fixing it moves the baseline. Fold it in when you are moving the
  baseline anyway.

## Scope

Six players. Base + PoK + Codices + Thunder's Edge. No variants, no galactic events. Faction content
outside the six trained factions is out of scope. Engine and policy features only — reward shaping
is explicitly not in scope. Training is paused by the user's decision; do not resume it.

## Two open bugs

- `plans/archive/BUG_2026-08-29_PRODUCTION_COMBINED_PAYMENT.md` — overlaps cluster 2.
- `plans/archive/BUG_2026-08-29_PROMISSORY_NOTE_TRANSACTION_OFFERS.md` — independent.

## On ownership

`crates/ti4-engine/src/action_cards.rs` and `crates/ti4-engine/src/agenda_effects.rs` were yours
during the split. I touched `action_cards.rs` once, in `4422407`, for two lines:
`frontline_deployment_puts_three_on_one_planet` had lost its `#[test]` attribute to a stray
duplicate introduced in `34b7b0d`, and had not been running since. Restored, and it passes — the
card was fine, only the test was switched off. Nothing else in that file changed.


## Still open (2026-08-31, end of session)

- **Phase 9: 63 rule topics still unverified.** Sixteen were checked against the rules text this
  session and found **seven defects in fourteen in-scope topics**. At that rate the remaining 63
  hold real bugs, so they are worth finishing; see the Phase 9 section of `engine-rules-audit.md`
  for what was checked and what it cost.
- **One rule found and deliberately not fixed**: 16.3c, "at the end of combat, any excess units are
  removed". `over_capacity` answers correctly; there is no caller after combat, so a carrier
  destroyed in a fight leaves its cargo standing and a stranded ground force can still invade.
  Wiring it there was tried and reverted -- Crash Landing and three other cards move units from
  windows that settle after the combat window closes, and enforcing first removes what they are
  about to rescue. Needs its own ordering change. Recorded in `fleet.rs`.
- **Two simplifications**: 95.1 pickup from systems moved *through* (origin only here), and 68.3b
  producing one unit of a two-for-one pair at full cost (not offered).
- **Training is still paused** by the owner's decision.

Both bugs are closed and the branch is merged.

### Simplifications recorded rather than hidden

- Anti-Intellectual Revolution destroys the *cheapest* non-fighter ship; the card says "must
  destroy 1" and does not say which, so a decider should choose.
- The Heart of Ixth reaches only the staged roll sites (space combat, space cannon). Bombardment,
  anti-fighter barrage and the gravity rift apply their dice immediately, so "after any die is
  rolled" is narrower here than on the card.
- Exploration command tokens go to the strategy pool without asking (LRR 52.4 lets the player
  choose). This one predates the current work.
